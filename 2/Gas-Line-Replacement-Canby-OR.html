<p>You may have heard stories about a hot water heater exploding inside a home or company! It is important to understand that a plugged temperature level and pressure relief valve on your water heater can turn your hot water heater into a dangerous time bomb. The age of your hot water heater. A standard tank hot water heater generally lasts anywhere from 8-12 years before needing a replacement, while a tankless hot water heater can last up to 20 with appropriate maintenance and care.

However even if you're sometimes getting bouts of cold water throughout your hot shower then you need to hire our League City water heater repair professionals.

Another good trick is utilizing a drain strainer to keep out hair and soap scum from getting in your pipes.</p>
