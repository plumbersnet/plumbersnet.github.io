<p>Leaks are tricky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>

<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code safeguards the public water supply and private on-site water supply and distribution systems by restricting cross-connections between drinkable (ideal for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by needing installation of main and secondary backflow prevention techniques.

If your plumber needs an authorization to repair the gas leak, which they'll probably have to do in the Atlanta city area, the charges to pull the authorization will add to your repair cost.
