<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements might have extremely tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a really vital part of the style of each part. If the part is not fixed properly, the guide might restrict the motion (instead of consistent or direct) of the part, which might trigger the element to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
