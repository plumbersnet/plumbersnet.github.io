<h3>How To Keep A Blocked Toilet From Becoming A Plumbing Catastrophe at Nicholasville KY 40356</h3>

When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not actually the flow of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you pour down there won't go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
