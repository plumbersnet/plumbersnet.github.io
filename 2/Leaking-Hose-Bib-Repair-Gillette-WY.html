<p>You notice rust in your water: If you start to observe rust in your water, it might be a sign that you need pipe repair or drain repair services. Rust often seeps into the water system when pipes have ended up being rusty. Although rust isn't inherently dangerous for your health, it can be an indicator of problem to come.
