The installation should be assessed to ensure it does not prevent the operations of the assembly. Test data should be built up to determine the operations of each component. The backflow prevention assembly should be disassembled and parts changed with initial factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly must be evaluated once again to be sure it was properly repaired. Comparing the test results from the fixed backflow prevention assembly to the manufacturers flow chart is required to guarantee it was repaired effectively.
