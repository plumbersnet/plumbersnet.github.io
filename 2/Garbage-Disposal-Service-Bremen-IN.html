Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>

<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Instead of removing the blockage with negative pressure, it in fact presses into the blockage, working even more into where the obstruction is taking place. The auger or snake" is then utilized to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to stream easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps require it further down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
