Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is minor, but if you have actually been advised by a medical professional to follow a strict low sodium diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
