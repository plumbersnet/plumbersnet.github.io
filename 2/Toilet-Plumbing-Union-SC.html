<p>Passive Purge - Up to 2007, some houses were enabled to bypass a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of several toilets in the house. Normally, the water supply to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each usage, fresh water was introduced into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
<p>In order to guarantee the appropriate operation of a backflow prevention assembly, it should be evaluated and certified upon installation and at least once a year afterwards if set up to secure form a health hazard circumstance. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and local water suppliers oversee these state requirements. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies have internal seals, springs, and moving parts that undergo fouling, use, or fatigue. Likewise, mechanical backflow preventers and air spaces can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow prevention assemblies need to be checked occasionally to ensure that they are functioning correctly. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies have to be evaluated with appropriately calibrated gauge equipment.</p>
