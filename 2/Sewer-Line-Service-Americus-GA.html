<p>It's Making Noise - As your water heats, there are minerals that are falling and separating to your tank's bottom. This will cause it to work more difficult and can create sound. If your energy costs are rising, a new, higher efficiency water heater can bring them pull back.

As a bathroom drain is likewise more difficult to repair and replace than a kitchen sink drain, it's most likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
