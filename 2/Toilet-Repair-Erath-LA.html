<p>Do you prepare to utilize fertigation (fertilizer injected into the watering water), apply fertilizer, pesticides (such as for bug control), or apply anything other than distilled water utilizing your watering system? This includes products identified as organic", natural", and safe". This likewise consists of the safe" mosquito control items used by misters and sprinklers.

<p>The City of Bellingham requires a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or potential cross-connection. The backflow preventer might be needed on the water service line, within the building, or in both places.

Assemblies not presently noted need to have been noted at the time of the initial installation.</p>
<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be connected to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws initially meant for the disposer discharge elbow.

Depending on the length of the waste arm, you might have the ability to cut off its elbow and use the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
