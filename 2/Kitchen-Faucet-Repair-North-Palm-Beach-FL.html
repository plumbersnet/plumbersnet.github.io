<p>No other room in a house contains as lots of pipes and plumbing components as the bathroom. Try to find quality materials when changing an under-sink assembly. Avoid flex pipe that can be bent into any setup, together with versatile rubber traps. Particles can easily catch in this type of piping while the piping's flexible nature does not offer required assistance for the drain basket.
