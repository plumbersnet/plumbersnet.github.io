<p>As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will build up in various parts of the plumbing system, many frequently in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can cause low circulation concerns or even stop a fixture from streaming entirely. The next common concern that happens with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which happens when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so extreme that it lowers the available volume of water that can stream around the system.</p>
<p>Responsive flow technology works by continuously bringing tanks off-line and online in response to the water needs of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow technology, only one of the 4 tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. Nevertheless, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill. This responsive design enables the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than conventional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
