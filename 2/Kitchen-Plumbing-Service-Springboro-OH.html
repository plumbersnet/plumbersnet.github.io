<h3>Why A Water Leak Detection System Is Important For Your Home in Springboro OH 45066</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
