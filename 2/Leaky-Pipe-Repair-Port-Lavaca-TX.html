At the least, it would have been a very costly option.</p>

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product coated with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits collect, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you want to make two times as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a new one.</p>
