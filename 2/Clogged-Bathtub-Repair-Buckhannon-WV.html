<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove particles such as difficult water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
<p>Culpeper House Services supplies professional garbage disposal solutions throughout Culpeper County. We will present you with choices for repair or replacement and suggest the best service depending upon your specific needs. For double-bowl sinks, the best method to tackle things is to utilize a continuous waste disposer package including a discharge tube, baffle tee, and tailpiece. Such sets direct both drains to a single trap. Depending on the location of the stub out, you'll need either an end outlet or center outlet kit.</p>
<p>The typical solution is to have the faulty pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is a choice to think about if you reside in an older house - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for many years, but steel ultimately struggles with deterioration and does not have the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
