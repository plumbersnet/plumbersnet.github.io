<h3>Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Plumbers Taylor MI</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>To make positioning a toilet much easier, new toilet bolts are extra long. That suggests you need to cut off the protruding ends later on with a hacksaw. But first link the water line, flush the toilet a number of times and look for leakages. Leaving the bolts uncut until you've done these final checks lets you quickly reset the toilet and eliminate if you discover any problems.</p>
