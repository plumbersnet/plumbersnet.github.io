Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created since of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals.
