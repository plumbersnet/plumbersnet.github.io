A water heater is essentially a household appliance that includes a gas or electrical heating unit under a tank in which water is heated and stored. You do not need a plumbing license for simple repairs such as unclogging a sink or if a plumbing permit is released as part of a larger residential building permit or commercial building license.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have moderately tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
