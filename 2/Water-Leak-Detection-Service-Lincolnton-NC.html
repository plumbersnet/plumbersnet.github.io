<p>You discover rust in your water: If you begin to discover rust in your water, it could be an indication that you need pipe repair or drain repair services. Rust often leaks into the water supply when pipes have actually become corroded. Although rust isn't inherently hazardous for your health, it can be an indication of trouble to come. If you buy a replacement that's made by the same producer as your old design, you might be able to bypass the need to replace the waste assembly and installing flange in the sink, significantly simplifying the task (it can be a bigger, more powerful unit-- it just needs to have the exact same installing flange).</p>
