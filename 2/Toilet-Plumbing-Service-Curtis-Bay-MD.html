Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
