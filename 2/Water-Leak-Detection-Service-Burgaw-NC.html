<p>A water softener is made up of a mineral tank and a backflush tank. It gathers hardness minerals within its conditioning tank and from time to time flushes them away to drain. Ion exchangers are typically used for water softening. When an ion exchanger is applied for water softening, it will replace the calcium and magnesium ions in the water with other ions such as sodium or potassium.

<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits build up, up until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up if you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs.</p>
