At the least, it would have been a really expensive alternative.</p>
<p>Building codes can differ from city to city, however all serve the same purpose. The substantial list of provisions and guidelines list the minimum requirements for the style and building of a commercial or residential structure. Buildings that don't follow local code are considered risky and are in need of an upgrade. In extreme cases, it's better to destroy old structures instead of spending the time and money on costly repairs or replacements.</p>
