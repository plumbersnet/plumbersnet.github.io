<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Instead of dislodging the obstruction with unfavorable pressure, it in fact presses into the obstruction, working even more into where the obstruction is happening. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to stream freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped tip assists require it further down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
