<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Instead of dislodging the obstruction with unfavorable pressure, it in fact presses into the obstruction, working even more into where the obstruction is happening.

The auger's corkscrew-shaped tip assists require it further down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
