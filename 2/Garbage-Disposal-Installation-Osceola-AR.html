However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a frequent incident, but it does take place more frequently than you think! When you don't notice the water was off for a couple of minutes, frequently it occurs at night. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs quickly the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical reason for backflow. Fire engine use huge pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically triggers the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding areas.</p>
