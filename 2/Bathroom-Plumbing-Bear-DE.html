At that time, people had no concept that the lead in the pipes could seep into the drinking water, not to mention the health dangers related to lead.</p>
<p>If your system frequently develops smells, it is possible to purchase disposal treatments that can help clean it and keep it odor free. They cost around $8 per treatment bottle.
