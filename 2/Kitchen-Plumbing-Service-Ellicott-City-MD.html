<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
