<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, happens. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the sodium, or salt, is kept and mixed with water. If you plan to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not utilize your unit to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate intact.</p>
<p>Responsive flow innovation works by constantly bringing tanks off-line and on-line in reaction to the water demands of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow innovation, just one of the 4 tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive design allows the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than traditional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
<p>Physical Damage: Fractures and damages to the physical water heater or water tank need help from qualified water heater contractors. Most of the times, we replace the harmed component to avoid leaking or rust. InSinkErator shows you how to install a waste disposal unit by following the actions detailed in the instructions manual and as displayed in this 4-minute video.</p>
<p>The appropriate repair of a backflow preventer requires lots of items to be evaluated. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly must be evaluated. The installation should be examined to ensure it does not prevent the operations of the assembly. Test data need to be collected to determine the workings of each component. The backflow prevention assembly should be disassembled and parts changed with initial factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly should be tested again to be sure it was effectively fixed. Comparing the test results from the repaired backflow prevention assembly to the manufacturers flowchart is needed to ensure it was repaired properly. An appropriately repaired assembly must offer years of defense.</p>
