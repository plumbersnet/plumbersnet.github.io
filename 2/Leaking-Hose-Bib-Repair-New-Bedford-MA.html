<p>The normal solution is to have the faulty pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an option to think about if you live in an older home - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for numerous decades, however steel ultimately suffers from corrosion and does not have the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
