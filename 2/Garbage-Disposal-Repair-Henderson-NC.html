The GFAVB is a non-testable system and are good for back siphonage only for non-health risk or health risk conditions. They should be set up downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on an irrigation system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It must also be set up a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local officials, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the greatest outlet).

When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is crucial that just original factory repair parts are utilized.
