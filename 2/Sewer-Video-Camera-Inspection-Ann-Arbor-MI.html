<h3>Getting Blocked Sewer Drainage Solutions at Ann Arbor MI 48103</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months earlier. I feel that prices were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list short article from March said depending on the marketplace and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
