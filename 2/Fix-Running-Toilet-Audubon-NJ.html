<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener parts. When these elements are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
