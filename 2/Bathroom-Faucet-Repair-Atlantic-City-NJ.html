<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Atlantic City NJ</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Repiping a home takes three to 5 days with a typical cost from $5,500 to $8,500, depending on home's size and the company doing the work. Wood recommends checking the credentials of various companies and getting estimates. With all this in mind, it's clear why water softeners are so popular: They remain the least costly and most reliable way to rid your water of troublesome minerals.</p>
