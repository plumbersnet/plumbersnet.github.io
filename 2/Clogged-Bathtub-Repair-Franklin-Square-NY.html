<h2>Tips To Hire Affordable Plumbing Service in Franklin Square</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Your sewer line is one of the most important parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes clogged or damaged, it might wreak unwanted problems on your property. A house's service line (likewise known as a sewer lateral) ranges from your home to the mainline sewer in the street. In most cases, the homeowner is responsible for preserving the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is accountable for keeping the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>Another duty of the Plumbing Division is to perform cross connection inspections to identify drinkable water supply that are in need of being secured from contaminates. The cross connection control program is required by the State of Michigan's Safe Drinking Water Act 1976 PA 399.

<p>Single flush High Effectiveness Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The most recent double flush HET used by Bonney will use an average of 1.1 gallons per flush.
