<p>The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank do not always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a pair of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if needed. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent sizes are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You might need to increase or decrease the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CAUTION: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Noticing high water pressure at plumbing fixtures in your house? Water pressure in the house resembles blood pressure in the body - it needs to be managed to keep the system healthy. When uncontrolled water pressure triggers damage to the plumbing system, this can cause emergency plumbing calls, like flooding. Having a water pressure regulator set up is A LOT MORE cost-effective than mold remediation or replacing floor covering or drywall! So we recommend repairing or setting up water pressure regulators to protect your whole home.</p>
