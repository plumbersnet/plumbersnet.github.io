<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
