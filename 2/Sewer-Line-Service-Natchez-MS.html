It needs to also be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local officials, require that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the greatest outlet). Some municipalities do not allow the use of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can just secure versus back siphonage.</p>
