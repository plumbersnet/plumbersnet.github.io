<h3>Choosing A Good Plumber Walhalla SC</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>This style water heater might make the many sense for you if you have a big bathtub or more that two bathrooms. There are some installation considerations, particularly around sizing the gas line and setting up the flue vent, but with the ability for a 50-gallon tank to create more warm water than a basic 80-gallon tank, these things are pretty special. High-efficiency storage is an excellent option for area heating hydronic choices too.</p>
