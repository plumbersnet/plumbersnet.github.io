For double-bowl sinks, the best way to set about things is to utilize a continuous waste disposer set including a discharge tube, baffle tee, and tailpiece. Such sets direct both drains to a single trap. Depending upon the area of the stub out, you'll need either an end outlet or center outlet set.</p>
<p>Pro Suggestion: If you're going to be draining a dishwasher through the unit, now is the best time to remove the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Utilize a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet up until the plug is broken off; retrieve the small piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is also the ideal time to make the connections for a hardwired unit with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
