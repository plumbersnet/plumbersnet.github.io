<h3>Choosing A Good Plumber Key West FL</h3>

When your water lines are repiped, it just suggests old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement.

We discover that repiping can actually be the less expensive and better long-lasting option if you do have frequent leakages.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have reasonably difficult water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
