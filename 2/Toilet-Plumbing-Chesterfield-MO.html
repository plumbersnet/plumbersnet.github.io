<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts might have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. An essential thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each element. If the component is not repaired appropriately, the guide could limit the movement (instead of direct or constant) of the part, which could trigger the part to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
