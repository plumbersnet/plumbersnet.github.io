<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in most cases it need to be much less water.</p>
