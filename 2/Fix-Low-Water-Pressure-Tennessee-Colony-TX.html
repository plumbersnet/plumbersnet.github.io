<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber In Tennessee Colony TX</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Examples of backflow conditions consist of backsiphonage and back pressure. Early diagnosis and repair can save your plumbing system from unneeded obstructions even more down the water lines.
