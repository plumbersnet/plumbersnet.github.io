Lowered Pressure Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP): An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of two individually acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and below the first check valve.</p>

Likewise, mechanical backflow preventers and air spaces can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow prevention assemblies have to be checked regularly to ensure that they are operating effectively. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies have to be tested with appropriately adjusted gauge equipment.</p>
