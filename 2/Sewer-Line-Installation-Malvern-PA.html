<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>

<p>It's Making sounds - As your water warms, there are minerals that are falling and separating to your tank's bottom. This will trigger it to work harder and can develop noise. If your energy costs are increasing, a new, higher effectiveness water heater can bring them pull back. All that has to be done is shutting off the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open up the bypass valve, permitting difficult water to flow to the storage tank and household taps. After that the softener can be disconnected, relocated to its new location and placed there.</p>
<p>Pro Idea: If you're going to be draining a dishwasher through the unit, now is the very best time to get rid of the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Use a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet till the plug is broken off; retrieve the little piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is likewise the perfect time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
