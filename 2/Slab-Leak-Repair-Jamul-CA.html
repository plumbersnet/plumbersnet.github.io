<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. No hot water in your house? Is your water taking too long to warm up? Is your water heater making sounds, or do you see rusty colored water in your home? If you have any of these problems, your water heater might need maintenance, repairs or even a replacement. While some of these concerns can be credited to normal wear and tear or incorrect installation, sometimes your garbage disposal ends up being damaged by items that should not be gone through it.</p>
<p>At Peoples, our goal is to preserve safe, reliable gas service for our clients. We are actively monitoring the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak internationally and in the U.S. We are working closely with the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention and the local health authorities to continually monitor the scenario and evaluate our operational response plans.</p>

The softener replaces these ions with salt through a process called ion exchange.</p>

<p>During regeneration, the water softener will take the brine solution into the softener tank and the ion exchange process takes place again, only this time in reverse.
