<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product covered with positively charged sodium ions.

The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
