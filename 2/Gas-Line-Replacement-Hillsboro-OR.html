<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, drain or cable television auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
