<p>Leaks are sneaky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, offering the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Once a big enough source of water has been recognized and assessed, the 3rd significant component of a water system system enters play: a system of pipelines to convey the water from its source to its consumers.

Generally constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) reinforced concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finish, these are big underground and aboveground pipes designed to carry bulk circulation amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and distribution nodes where the flows are moved to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. Many big cities need numerous aqueducts providing water from varied and geographically separated sources.</p>
