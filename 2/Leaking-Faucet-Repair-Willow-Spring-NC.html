<p>Have actually used Plumb Crazy on three different events, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our specialists and they were great. They quickly found the leak and repaired it without making a big mess. They, as with everyone we have actually come across with Plumb Crazy, were polite, timely, and extremely well-informed. I would recommend Plumb Crazy to anyone needing either small or large job plumbing work.</p>
<p>Tankless electric hot water heater can be found in 2 types. There are whole-house heaters that are large and powerful enough to provide hot water to all restrooms, kitchens, and appliances in a home. On the other hand, there are the point-of-use electric heaters that provide hot water to particular spaces or appliances only. Both whole-house and point-of-use heaters work the very same way. The only difference is the quantity of water they can heat up at any given time. Likewise, whole-house systems are substantially more expensive than the point of use systems.</p>
