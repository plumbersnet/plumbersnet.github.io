<p>This post aims to address the typical misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes deterioration This is not the case: a correctly set up water softener does not make the cured water more destructive. Here are a few confusing facts that typically lead individuals to this erroneous conclusion. Initially, naturally soft water is generally corrosive. For that reason, softened water must also be destructive, right? This is a fallacy since naturally soft water tends to be destructive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening causes neither of these conditions.</p>
