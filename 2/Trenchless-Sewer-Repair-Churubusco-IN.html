<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite affordable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs.

These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life.
