<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return due to the fact that he had another appointment. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
