<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits collect, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits take place more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe.

If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a new one.</p>
