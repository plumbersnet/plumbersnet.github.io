They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.
