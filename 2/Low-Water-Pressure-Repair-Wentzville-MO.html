This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather defense. As the external covering of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
