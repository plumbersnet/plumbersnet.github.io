<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>

<p>It's a strangely intricate scientific process, however simple to fix. It uses salt to get rid of minerals and smells discovered in hard water- most typically calcium and magnesium.

Pumps push tough water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with salt ions, softening the water.</p>
