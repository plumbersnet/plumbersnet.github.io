This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is simply catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations at the same time (usually sodium or often potassium).</p>
