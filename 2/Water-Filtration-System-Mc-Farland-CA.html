<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capability. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
