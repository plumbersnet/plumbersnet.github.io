<h3>Water Heater Repair Services at Somerville TN 38068</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
