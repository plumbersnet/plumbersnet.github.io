<p>Last but not least, the most advanced and complicated backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 separately running valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. During basic water streams at design pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if costly) device is best utilized in vital locations where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
