<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile water system line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh.

Links that are too tight can actually cause leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If needed, check for leaks and tighten them a bit more.</p>
