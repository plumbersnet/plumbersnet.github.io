<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and insured and satisfy our stiff trust accreditation standards. A great guideline is to replace faucets that show corrosion, rust, cracks, and otherwise deep damages. Damaged and rusted parts make repairs hard and expensive, suggesting a faucet installation is more rewarding. Repairs are the right fix for issues such as missing or harmed washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other little components of the entire component. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we suggest a new faucet installation.</p>
<p>Next, check the body. Depending on the size and producer, the bodies can be made of bronze, plastic, stainless steel, cast iron or ductile iron. It is once again important for the repair technician to be aware of the solidity of the materials so that their cleaning process is not harmful. In the larger backflow prevention assemblies (2 - 10") the iron bodies will be covered to minimize any scale development or rust. It is necessary that the repair professional is delicate to the firmness and type of the various finishes utilized on iron body units so as not to harm the protective covering.</p>
