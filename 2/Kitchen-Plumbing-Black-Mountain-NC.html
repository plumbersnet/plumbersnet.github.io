<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>

To discover an appropriate replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water before getting rid of the flapper.)
