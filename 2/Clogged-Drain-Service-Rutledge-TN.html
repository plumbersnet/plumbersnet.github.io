Plumber's putty can not be used on specific brand-new sinks, but these will be identified to that impact. Utilize a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. When you tighten the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to insert the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
