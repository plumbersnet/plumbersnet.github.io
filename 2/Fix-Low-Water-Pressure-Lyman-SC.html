<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like material covered with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
