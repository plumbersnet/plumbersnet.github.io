<p>We're replacing a gas water heater in our demonstration. The steps for replacing a lp water heater are precisely the same, and those for an electric hot water heater are comparable. Repeating repairs and leakages. If your hot water heater is over ten years old, it has likely lost much of its performance; continuing to repair it, with its regular breakdowns, is not cost-effective in the long run.

<p>If the hot water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is a sign the tank is failing and will need to be replaced. Schedule a price quote as soon as possible and make sure absolutely nothing is near the heater that might be potentially damaged if it is in a garage and a little sluggish leak.
