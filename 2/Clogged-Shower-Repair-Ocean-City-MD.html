Take your brand-new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Bear in mind that since of the method a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the correct method. When you have actually protected the journey lever and are ready to link your flapper, make sure you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
