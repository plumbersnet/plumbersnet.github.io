It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on really slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be examined to ensure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close correctly. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are totally open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
<p>Check the disposal. Turn the power back on, run water into the sink and turn on the disposal to make sure it works. Examine beneath to be sure there aren't any leakages.
