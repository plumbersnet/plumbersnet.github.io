<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not really the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there won't go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
<p>Prior to setting up, your professional will switch off water and electricity to the area. Next, the old sink flange is removed and cleaned up of any putty residue. Then, a new installing ring is set up to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is connected, and the disposal is linked to its install. In this method, water is treated with a calculated quantity of washing soda (Na2CO3) which converts the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get sped up.</p>
