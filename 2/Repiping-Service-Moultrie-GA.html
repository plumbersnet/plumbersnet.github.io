Dealing with repairing a burst pipe is definitely not worth the cost savings incurred from using a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a fantastic guy. He told me precisely what to expect (cost, time, procedure) in advance and delivered as assured. I will certainly use Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These rates are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit.
