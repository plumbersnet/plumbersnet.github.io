<h3>How to Keep A Clogged Toilet From Becoming A Disaster in Montgomery TX 77356</h3>
<p>Water that has been entirely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this kind of corrosion A softener is just capturing some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (normally salt or in some cases potassium).</p>
