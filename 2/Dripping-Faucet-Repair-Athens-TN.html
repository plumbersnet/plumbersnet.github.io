<p>No other room in a home includes as numerous pipes and plumbing components as the bathroom. We now have actually cleaned and inspected the parts, changed the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their components, cleaned up the body and the seats and flushed the incoming water line. We are now all set to begin the re-assembly procedure. Some models require the parts to be removed in a particular order. These assemblies will also need the re-assembly in a particular order. Many components can not be re-installed into the body unless the test cocks are left open. As each element is put back into the body, it is essential to put them back in the proper location. It is also important that as they are put back into the body, that no contaminant is connected on the parts or accidentally positioned in the body. The parts must be placed so that the guides have the ability to preserve their created tolerances.</p>

<p>Last but not least, the most complex and advanced backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five independently operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. During basic water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if expensive) device is best used in important areas where cross contamination might be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
