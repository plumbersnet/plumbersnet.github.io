<h3>Things To Consider Before Hiring A Plumber Oregon City OR</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when searching for a viable option, especially when easy plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are many disadvantages to using these harmful items - not least of which is that they usually contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of providing the threat of damage to your home and family.</p>
