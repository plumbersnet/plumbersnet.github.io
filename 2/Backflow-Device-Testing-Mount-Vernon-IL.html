Due to the fact that the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system.

The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless most of the times it need to be much less water.</p>
