Typically constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable coating, these are big underground and aboveground pipes created to bring bulk flow amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and distribution nodes where the circulations are moved to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. Many large cities need numerous aqueducts supplying water from varied and geographically separated sources.</p>
