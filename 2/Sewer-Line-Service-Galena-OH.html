<p>Leakages are sly. In time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capability to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain.
