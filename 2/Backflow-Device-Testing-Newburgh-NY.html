<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede against the required direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being infected. There is capacity for the infected water to end up being a health threat if allowed to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply.

<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a flexible water system line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can actually trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If required, inspect for leakages and tighten them a bit more.</p>
