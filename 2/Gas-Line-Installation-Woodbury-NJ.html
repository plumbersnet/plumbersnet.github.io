<p>Leaks are tricky. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
