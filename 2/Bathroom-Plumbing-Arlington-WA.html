<p>Downspout Drains: These clog with leaves and debris and can stop working to carry water from roof gutters far from your home or business when not effectively maintained. Even if you take good care of your drains by covering them and avoiding pouring any liquid fat, oil, and grease down them, in some cases clogs are inevitable. If you have a clogged drain, it is incredibly important that you do not attempt to unclog it yourself due to the fact that this might possibly result in a big leak and more pricey repairs.</p>
