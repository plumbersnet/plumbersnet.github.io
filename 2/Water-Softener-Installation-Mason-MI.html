<p>Leakages are tricky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capacity to soften hard water.

Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain.
