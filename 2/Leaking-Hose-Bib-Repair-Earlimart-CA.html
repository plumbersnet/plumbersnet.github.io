<p>Lastly, the most advanced and complex backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 individually running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other four. Throughout standard water flows at style pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if costly) device is best utilized in critical areas where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
