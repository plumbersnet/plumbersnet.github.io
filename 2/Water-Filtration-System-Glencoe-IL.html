<p>A recently installed water heater should not produce unusual noises, but it will begin to generate rumbling noises as it ages. The noises get louder with time as the heater runs to warm the water. Things get worse significantly for families with a high need for warm water. The factors for the sounds can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which must be flushed to bring back normalcy. A water heater replacement may be required if the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has been flushed.</p>
