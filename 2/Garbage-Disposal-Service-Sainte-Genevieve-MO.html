Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
