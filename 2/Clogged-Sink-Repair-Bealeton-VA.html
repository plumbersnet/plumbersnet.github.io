A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800).

It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on extremely gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be checked to ensure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close appropriately when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
