<p>These are all signs that your unit ought to be checked by a plumber. We do not recommend attempting to repair this particular home appliance by yourself, since it does present a safety threat, due to the sharp blades that are utilized to slice and grind waste. You ought to also prevent using any kind of chemical drain cleaners on your waste disposal unit due to the fact that these chemicals will just harm the appliance further.</p>

<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits build up, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes.

If you wish to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a new one.</p>
