<p>Think about all the areas water flows in and out of your house. These are the locations that a professional assessment must cover. That includes your piping, sinks, faucets, toilets, and other home appliances. Even your water lines ought to be covered. While your hot water heater and toilets will receive special attention, an experienced plumber wants to take a look at the complete health of your system. That means testing for proper water pressure. After all, too much pressure can harm your plumbing, and too little can leave your home with inefficient water appliances.</p>
<p>Changing your flapper might require somewhat different steps than we reveal (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task. To find a suitable replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Shut off the water before removing the flapper.) You might not find an identical match, however opportunities are you'll locate one of the very same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
