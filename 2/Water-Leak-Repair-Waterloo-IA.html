<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements may have very tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the element. The guide is a very crucial part of the design of each element. If the component is not fixed correctly, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than direct or consistent) of the component, which could trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the part causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>

At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution.
