<h3>Faucet Problems That Need Faucet Replacement in Somerville MA 02145</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
