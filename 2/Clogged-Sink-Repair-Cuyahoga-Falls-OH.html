<p>Tankless systems last 5-10 years longer than tanked systems and need fewer repairs with time. Sanford & Child plumbing offers sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding areas. During regeneration, salted water from the brine tank streams up the fill tube and into the softener tank.
