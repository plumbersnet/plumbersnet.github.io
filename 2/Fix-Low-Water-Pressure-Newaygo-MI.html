That's not all, a gas leak fire also causes other gas-run devices to blow up such as clothes dryer, water fireplaces, stoves, and heaters.</p>
<p>Then connect the drain (and dishwasher hose, if appropriate). If your unit is outlet-ready-- focus on this part-- make sure your disposal switch is in the off" position before you plug the new unit in. While it's unlikely that having a disposal start up while your head is pushed versus it will cause decapitation, it may frighten a couple of years off your life. Not that I would understand from experience.</p>
