<p>Difficult water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are changed in the solution by the salt ions.</p>

The contractor needs to have a valid, current plumbing license, current insurance, backflow preventer testing certification, and currently calibrated test package.
