<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems generally are set up in locations where water might trigger disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and areas with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is minor, but if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a strict low sodium diet this increase can position problems.</p>
