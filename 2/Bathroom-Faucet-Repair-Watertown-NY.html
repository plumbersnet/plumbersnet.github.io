<p>Before setting up, your professional will switch off water and electrical energy to the area. Next, the old sink flange is removed and cleaned up of any putty residue. Then, a new mounting ring is installed to the bottom of the sink, the sink drain is connected, and the disposal is hooked up to its mount.
