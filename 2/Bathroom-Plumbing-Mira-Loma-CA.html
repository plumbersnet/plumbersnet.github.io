<p>Physical strength. Pipefitters, steamfitters, and plumbers need to be able to lift and move heavy tools and materials. Idea: Place a heavy things such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving throughout installation. Loosen the clamp and eliminate the dishwasher drain hose from the disposal.

<p>The typical option is to have the faulty pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an option to think about if you live in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for many decades, but steel eventually suffers from rust and lacks the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
