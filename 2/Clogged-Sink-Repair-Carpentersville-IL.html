<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years old and you have to hire a plumber for that burner package. The total repair bill might be in the $300 range. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Choose the brand-new heater.</p>
