<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a feasible solution, specifically when simple plunging does not appear to work. However, there are many drawbacks to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they usually consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, however at the cost of providing the danger of harm to your house and household.</p>
