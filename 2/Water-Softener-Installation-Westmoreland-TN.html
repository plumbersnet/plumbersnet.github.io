<p>Your disposer may include a thin rubber gasket to be used under the sink flange, instead of the conventional plumber's putty as laid out below. Both will produce an excellent seal (though the gasket might result in percentages of water collecting around the flange), and what's used is largely a matter of preference.

Detach garbage disposal wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen screws on the electrical clamp adapter and remove wires from the waste disposal unit.</p>
