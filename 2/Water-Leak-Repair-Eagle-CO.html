<p>Here at High 5 Plumbing, our Denver drain cleaning team is proud to use Bio-Clean items for each drain-cleaning task. Bio-Clean is an all-natural service that's both safe to your plumbing and remarkably efficient at eliminating gunk, waste, and organic material that so typically blocks your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, wearing away the sidewalls and only partly repairing the problem. Bio-Clean is a solution of live bacteria that actively look for organic material and gnaw at it, producing harmless byproducts of carbon dioxide, mineral, and water ash, all of which are quickly treated at local sewage plants.</p>
