They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements.

For gas water heaters, a specific gas line has to be set up and a practical source of gas established. Another function of an electric hot water heater is that they do not need any ventilation. Gas models need to be aerated appropriately using vents and ducts in order to function properly. With electric models, you will not need to install any new vents or ducts in your house.</p>
