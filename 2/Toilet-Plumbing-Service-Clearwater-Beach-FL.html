A home's service line (likewise called a sewer lateral) runs from your house to the mainline sewer in the street. Most of the times, the property owner is responsible for preserving the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is accountable for maintaining the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
