<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these aspects are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
<p>In fact, reverse circulation testing created to ensure that backflow preventers avoid backflow was eliminated from NFPA 25 in 2011. While NFPA acknowledges that backflow remains a genuine health issue, it considers preventing it outside the scope of NFPA 25. Rather, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will ensure that backflow preventers are correctly evaluated by qualified workers.</p>
<p>Hard water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals. When the water is available in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are changed in the option by the salt ions.</p>
