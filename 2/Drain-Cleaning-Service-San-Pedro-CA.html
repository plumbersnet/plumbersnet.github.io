<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Examine spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>

<p>Rusty water: If you have rusty water coming out of your faucets, particularly if that water is hot, the inside of your system is most likely rusty.
