<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to collect your yard. Throughout a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain professional runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images captured by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
