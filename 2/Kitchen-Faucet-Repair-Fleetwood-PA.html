I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return due to the fact that he had another visit.
