<p>Leaks are sneaky. Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant.

WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
