<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to remove particles such as tough water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
<p>A cross-connection is any irreversible or short-lived connection in between a public water system or consumer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping in between a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or irrigation system.</p>
