But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have moderately hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>

<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems.

Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line.
