For this reason, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this type of deterioration A softener is just capturing some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (usually salt or often potassium).</p>
