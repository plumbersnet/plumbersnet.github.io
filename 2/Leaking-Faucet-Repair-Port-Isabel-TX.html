However, there are lots of disadvantages to utilizing these dangerous items - not least of which is that they usually consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life.
