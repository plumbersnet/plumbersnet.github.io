<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return since he had another consultation. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most common. To eliminate the disposer, support it from below and turn the big, 3-tab installing ring on top counterclockwise up until the system falls away. Remove the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening up the 3 bolts and prying off the keeping ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
