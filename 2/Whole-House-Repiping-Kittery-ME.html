<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you need to work with a plumber for that burner package. The overall repair costs might be in the $300 variety. A gas hot water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Opt for the brand-new heater.</p>
