When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being infected. If allowed to re-enter the supply of water, there is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health danger. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for effectiveness, along with inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
