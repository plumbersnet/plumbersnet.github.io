Some elements might have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each part. If the element is not repaired correctly, the guide could limit the movement (instead of steady or direct) of the component, which could cause the part to not work to its abilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the component causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
