<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
