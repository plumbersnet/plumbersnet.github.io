Principal types consist of: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not end up being practical to produce up until 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. established a method to plasticize PVC, making it easier to process. PVC pipe began to be made in the 1940s and remained in broad use for Drain-Waste-Vent piping throughout the restoration of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics producers in Western Europe and Japan started producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe.

<p>The normal service is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is a choice to think about if you reside in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for many decades, but steel ultimately suffers from rust and lacks the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
