<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another consultation, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly shown here is the most common.

Remove the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening the three bolts and spying off the retaining ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
