<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off.

One way to stop, or at least reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however in most cases it should be much less water.</p>
