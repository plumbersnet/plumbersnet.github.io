<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that enables water to go through it in one direction, however prevents it from going backwards in the opposite direction. You might be knowledgeable about galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, basically, the exact same thing, however without the zinc coating. The zinc coating on galvanized pipe for gas is implied to keep the pipe from corroding from contact with moisture. While it does its task pretty well, in time, it still does wear away. This allows the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Examine spring (for instance, to 90 psi). This pressure difference throughout the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
