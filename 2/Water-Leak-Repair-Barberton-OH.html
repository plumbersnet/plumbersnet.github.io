<p>The key to the innovation is having the ability to control both the crystal development rate and their removal from our polymer beads, thereby getting rid of hardness ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not need replacement chemicals or regeneration of active websites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary technology officer. This technology is more cost efficient and lasts longer than common water softening items such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capability and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank is available in. An on-board computer calculates the quantity of water that streams through the softener. Regrowth automatically begins when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and household of 4, regeneration usually takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>

Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for numerous decades, however steel eventually suffers from corrosion and lacks the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
