That detergent savings increases to almost 70% when comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level.</p>

If not-- or if there is no disposal presently in place-- start by removing the old drain. A lot of drains are attached to the sink by a big nut beneath the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen up.</p>
