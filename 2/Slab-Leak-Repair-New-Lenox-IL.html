<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies New Lenox IL</h3>
<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing interruption service may look like a waste of money. Why invest in professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will suffice? While chemical drain cleaners might be an inexpensive option, the harsh ingredients rust your inner drain pipe, with time, producing vulnerable points in the pipe that are most likely to burst. Dealing with repairing a burst pipe is certainly not worth the cost savings incurred from using a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively thought of. If you have moderately difficult water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
