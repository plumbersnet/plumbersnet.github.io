<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Hopkins MN</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, cable or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
