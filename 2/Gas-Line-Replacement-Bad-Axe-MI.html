<h3>Fix a Leaky Outside Frost Free Faucet in Bad Axe MI 48413</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months earlier. I feel that costs were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list short article from March stated depending on the market and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>

Warning: some plumbers installed stub outs" of copper when leaving the wall. Because copper is revealing does not suggest you do not have polybutylene pipes, simply. You might need to make a little hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
