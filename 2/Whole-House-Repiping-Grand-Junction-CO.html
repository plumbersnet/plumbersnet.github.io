<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Grand Junction CO</h3>
<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing stoppage service may appear like a waste of cash. Why purchase professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will suffice? While chemical drain cleaners might be an affordable option, the extreme ingredients corrode your inner drain pipe, over time, developing weak points in the pipe that are likely to rupture. Dealing with repairing a burst pipe is certainly not worth the savings sustained from using a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>Tree roots can be a major factor in affected sewer lines. Tree roots grow in several directions and can get large causing intrusion of the lines underground. Another fact is that tree roots search for water sources and will follow the source leading them directly to sewer lines ultimately growing right into them and triggering significant sewer line problems.</p>
