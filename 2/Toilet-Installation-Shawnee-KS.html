<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Instead of dislodging the blockage with negative pressure, it actually pushes into the blockage, working even more into where the obstruction is occurring. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to stream freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps force it even more down into the clog, making it simpler to clear.</p>
