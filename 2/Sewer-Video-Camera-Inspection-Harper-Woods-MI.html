To remove the disposer, support it from below and rotate the big, 3-tab installing ring on top counterclockwise until the unit falls away. Eliminate the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening the three bolts and spying off the keeping ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
