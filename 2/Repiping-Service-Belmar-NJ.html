<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have reasonably difficult water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
