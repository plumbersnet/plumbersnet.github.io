<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener elements. When these components are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
<p>Responsive circulation innovation works by continually bringing tanks off-line and online in response to the water needs of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow innovation, just one of the four tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. Nevertheless, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design enables the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than traditional single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>
