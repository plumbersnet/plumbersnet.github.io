<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another visit, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Disposers attach to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most common.

Remove the rest of the drain assembly by loosening up the 3 bolts and spying off the keeping ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
