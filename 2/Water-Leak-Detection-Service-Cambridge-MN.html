<p>Some states need pipefitters and steamfitters to be licensed; they might likewise require a special license to work on gas lines. Licensing normally requires an examination or work experience or both. Contact your state's licensing board to find out more. No, but you may need to collaborate with a Vectren representative to get to your property to perform service work, including relighting your natural gas devices.</p>
