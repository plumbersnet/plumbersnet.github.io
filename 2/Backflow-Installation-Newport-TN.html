<p>It is strongly recommended to consult a plumbing professional to do a plumbing inspection if you are uncertain about any plumbing problems the home might have. It would not be the first time that new owners failed to notice some severe problems due to their lack of experience, say the people who own and run Dial up Plumbing, which in return will set them back way more than professional plumbing inspection service charge would. On top of that, you will get a repair quote and you can work out a discount rate with the sellers to cover the unforeseen expenditures.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely pictured. If you have moderately hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
