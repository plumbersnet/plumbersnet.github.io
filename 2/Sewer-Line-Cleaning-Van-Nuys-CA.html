Softened water (measured as recurring sodium carbonate index) in which calcium and magnesium have been partly changed by sodium is not ideal for watering usage, as it tends to cause the development of alkali soils 18 Non-chemical devices are typically utilized in location of traditional water softening for this application.</p>

<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to overcome osmotic pressure and get rid of water molecules from the option with firmness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water molecules for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water system is devoid of firmness ions without any other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter requiring routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
