<h3>Basic Plumber Tools For Any Job Goffstown NH</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Not all toilet problems require the help of a professional. Some small obstructions can be taken care of with a plunger and typically, when the toilet will not stop running, it's a simple matter of changing the chain on the flapper valve inside the tank. However, particular issues do require a qualified plumber, and it's important to understand the distinction to avoid squandered time, frustration, and money.</p>
