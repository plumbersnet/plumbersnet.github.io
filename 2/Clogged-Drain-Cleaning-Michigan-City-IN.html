Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
