<p>Specialty Salts: Different geographic areas have different water sources and mineral material. Diamond Crystal ® items address specific problems such as iron concentration, rust discolorations and salt content. Uncertain whether or not you have a backflow prevention device set up? Usually, it's installed near your culinary stop and waste. David Davia is the Executive Vice President & CEO of the Colorado Association of Mechanical and Plumbing Contractors.

<p>The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, but it doesn't grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck. Attempt freeing the jam by inserting a hex wrench of the proper size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. Alternately, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom deal with (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
<p>Though it's not always essential, often the plumber might have to update or repair electrical wiring to power the brand-new garbage disposal. This usually costs an extra $50 to $100+.
