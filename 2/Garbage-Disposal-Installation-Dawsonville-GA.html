<p>A lot of homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather security. As the external finishing of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
