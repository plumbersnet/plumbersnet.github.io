However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is extensively envisioned. If you have moderately tough water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
