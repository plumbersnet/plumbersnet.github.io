<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material covered with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water streams through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>

When you call Pratt Plumbing, we'll send out a knowledgeable specialist to your house. He or she will treat you with the utmost regard and courtesy.
