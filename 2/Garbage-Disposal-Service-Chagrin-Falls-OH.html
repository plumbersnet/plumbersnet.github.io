<p>Backflow is water flowing in the opposite instructions from its typical flow. IRWD's drinkable water supply is developed to keep the water flowing to you. When hydraulic conditions within any water supply deviate from "regular," the instructions of water flow can be reversed. This creates a backflow condition and the potential for polluted water getting in the safe and clean water circulation system.</p>
<p>Oregon state laws governing water supply require backflow prevention assemblies to be installed on water services where cross connections can not be removed. Backflow assemblies are required to be set up on the water service connections to all fire sprinkler and landscape sprinkler systems. The law likewise requires backflow assemblies in commercial facilities such as mortuaries and health centers, as well as industrial centers.</p>
