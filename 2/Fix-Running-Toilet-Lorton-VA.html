<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains at Lorton VA 22079</h3>

This is because the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The probability of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe.
