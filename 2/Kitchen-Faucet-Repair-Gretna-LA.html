<p>A water softener eliminates minerals that produce water hardness, among the most common water quality problems a house owner encounters. Difficult water destroys appliances, leaves filmy soap scum throughout bathrooms and kitchen areas, and dries hair and skin. With over 85% of the United States relying on tough water for their cooking, cleaning, and bathing, water softeners serve an important purpose. A water softener conserves you from replacing too soon ruined water heaters, scaly faucet heads, and hours and hours of tidying up soapy residue. Investing in a water softener saves you energy, time, and cash, and safeguards your house and your home.</p>
<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This leads to micro-fractures and lowers the standard structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and might stop working without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Improper installation is likewise a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to spot.</p>
<p>Discharge piping connected to a storm sewer shall be equipped with backwater check valve. In commercial applications, for example, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices recommends a DCV assembly on dry or damp sprinkler systems unless there is a threat of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is suggested.</p>
