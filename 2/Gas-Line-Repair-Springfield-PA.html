<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super happy with their service.</p>
<p>Homeowners can practice preventive maintenance to prevent future drainage concerns. As soon as a. month, use a plunger in your shower and tub drains to eliminate any stuck-on debris.
