<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Medford OR 97504</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written estimate to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, because I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months back. I feel that costs were increased since I had a "Offer". An Angie's list article from March stated depending on the marketplace and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
