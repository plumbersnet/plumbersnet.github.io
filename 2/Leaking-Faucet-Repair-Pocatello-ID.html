<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. In time, the deposits build up, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up if you desire to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a new one.</p>
