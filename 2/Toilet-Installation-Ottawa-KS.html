<p>The appropriate repair of a backflow preventer requires many products to be examined. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly must be evaluated. The installation should be examined to ensure it does not circumvent the workings of the assembly. Test information need to be collected to determine the functions of each part. The backflow prevention assembly must be dismantled and parts replaced with original factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly must be tested again to be sure it was correctly repaired. Comparing the test results from the fixed backflow prevention assembly to the makers flow chart is essential to guarantee it was repaired effectively. An appropriately repaired assembly should offer years of protection.</p>
