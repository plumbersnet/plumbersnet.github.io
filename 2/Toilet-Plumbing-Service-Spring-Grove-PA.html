<p>If you see a smell or undesirable smell originating from your system, which is not uncommon, think about buying a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where foul smells can escape. These flanges are simple and commonly available to install, costing around $30 in the house improvement or hardware shops. Turn off the supply of water to your home at the main line. To prevent leaks from springing throughout the installation procedure, shut down the water system to your house. Make certain your hot water heater's water supply is turned off, as is the electrical energy going to the unit.</p>
