It is important that the plumbing system be turned on very gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to make sure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are completely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
