<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY project. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
