<p>Hard water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions move out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the service by the salt ions.</p>
<p>It's a strangely complicated clinical procedure, but simple to correct. It utilizes salt to get rid of minerals and odors discovered in difficult water- most typically calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems utilize resin beads that connect and attract sodium ions in the softener tank. Pumps press hard water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>
