<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back versus the required direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being infected. There is potential for the infected water to become a health risk if allowed to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected frequently for efficiency, along with inspected each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
