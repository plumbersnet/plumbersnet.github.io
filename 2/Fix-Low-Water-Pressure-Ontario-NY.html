Some parts may have very tight tolerances that have to be preserved. A crucial thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the element. The guide is an extremely critical part of the design of each element. If the part is not fixed appropriately, the guide could limit the motion (instead of steady or direct) of the element, which might cause the part to not work to its capabilities.
