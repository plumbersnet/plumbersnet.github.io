<p>Last but not least, the most advanced and complex backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five separately operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. During basic water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if pricey) device is best used in important areas where cross contamination might be a direct danger to life and health.</p>

Many water softeners are hardware on which you can rely.</p>
