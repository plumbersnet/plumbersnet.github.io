<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water technology start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, announced today they have accomplished an advancement in water softening treatment utilizing an exclusive Surface Accelerated Condensation (SACr) innovation. SACr physically eliminates short-lived solidity without utilizing chemicals or high pressure, which are major constraints of present softening innovations.</p>

A garbage disposal repair service can help identify and fix a clogged waste disposal unit.</p>
<p>GGP is always prepared to repair any of these types of sinks. Should you experience a specialty faucet repair that requires unique order parts, we can put the order and get the sink fixed as soon as the part gets here.
