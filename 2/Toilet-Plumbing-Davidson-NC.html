<h3>How to Overcome Sink Drain Problems in Davidson NC 28036</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these elements are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in tough water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
