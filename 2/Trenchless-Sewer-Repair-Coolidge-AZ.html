<p>No warm water-- The absence of warm water is the most significant indication that there is something incorrect with your San Antonio hot water heater.

If your water heater isn't doing its only task, it's time to seek advice from the professionals.</p>
<p>Water softening refers to the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular approach of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. Throughout ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- generally sodium. The outcome is water that's been efficiently softened by removing nearly all traces of the minerals that constitute difficult water.</p>
