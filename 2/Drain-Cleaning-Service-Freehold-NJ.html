<p>106.2.2.1 Besides Group R-3 Occupancies. The intent of the 10-percent guideline exclusions in Section 106.2.2 shall apply to minor repairs and replacement piping just. In buildings other than Group R-3 tenancies, an authorization and inspection will be required for more extensive work if more than 10-percent (nominal) of a floor level, area, or wing is involved, despite the fact that the floor level, wing, or area specifies less than 10-percent (small) of the total structure plumbing.</p>
<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. Since the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless in most cases it should be much less water.</p>
