<h3>Residential Water Heater Repair and Replacement in Tahlequah OK 74464</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
