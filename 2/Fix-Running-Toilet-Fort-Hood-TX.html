<p>If you're dealing with decreased pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and endless home appliance repair expenses, you need a water softener. Difficult water is not a problem that will disappear by itself and the costs incurred by tough water will just continue to escalate.

That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
