<p>Plastic pipe remains in broad usage for domestic water supply and drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe. Principal types include: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not end up being useful to make until 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. developed a technique to plasticize PVC, making it much easier to process. PVC pipe started to be produced in the 1940s and remained in broad use for Drain-Waste-Vent piping during the restoration of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics producers in Western Europe and Japan started producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe.

<p>If you do not have a plumber's snake, you can utilize a wire coat hanger by correcting it. Of course, it won't reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it might be long enough to reach some blockages. If you can reach it, place it into the kitchen drain or stub pipe to push through or pull out the clog. Be careful not to scratch your sink with the wire.</p>
