<h3>The Importance of Drain Cleaning and How it Affects Your Home in Lynchburg VA 24502</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these aspects are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new sodium ions.</p>
