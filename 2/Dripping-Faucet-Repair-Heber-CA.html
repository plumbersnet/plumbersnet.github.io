<p>If you're living with decreased pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and endless appliance repair bills, you need a water softener. Hard water is not an issue that will disappear by itself and the expenses incurred by hard water will just continue to escalate. With a water softener, appliances will undoubtedly stop working earlier than their expected life-span. If scale continues to collect in your pipes, your flow rate will continue to restrict and you risk losing water pressure throughout your home. Hard water ravages hot water heater, and without a softener, your utility bills will continue to barrel skyward. The continuous cycle of repairs and replacements will continue till your home is secured by a water softener if your water supply is hard.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions also permit options to backflow preventers. For instance, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, due to the fact that every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
