The hourly charge for a plumbing contractor is $72 to $82, which does not include materials or parts. Prices depend upon the exact repair needed, where you live, employing a plumber vs. working with a handyman, and whether or not you can DIY it.</p>
<p>Our licensed plumbing professionals can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by attaching a hose to drain the tank to an appropriate drain. Flushing the water heating tank must be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner might provide a fast fix in the short-term, it can cause far more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run.
