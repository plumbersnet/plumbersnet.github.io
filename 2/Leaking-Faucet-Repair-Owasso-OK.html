<p>Here at High 5 Plumbing, our Denver drain cleaning team is happy to use Bio-Clean products for every single drain-cleaning job. Bio-Clean is a natural service that's both safe to your plumbing and remarkably reliable at getting rid of gunk, waste, and organic material that so typically clogs up your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, corroding the sidewalls and only partially repairing the problem.

<p>These are all indications that your unit should be inspected by a plumber. We don't recommend trying to repair this specific appliance by yourself, due to the fact that it does provide a safety hazard, due to the sharp blades that are utilized to chop and grind waste. You need to also prevent utilizing any type of chemical drain cleaners on your garbage disposal due to the fact that these chemicals will just damage the appliance even more.</p>
<p>Discover if there are any lead pipes in the house. Homes that were constructed prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing.

You may not want to live in a house that has lead pipes if you have children.</p>
