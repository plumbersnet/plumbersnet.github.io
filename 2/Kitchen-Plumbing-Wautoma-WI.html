<p>Rust: The most typical issue is deterioration in the tank and pipes that connect to your water heater. This is specifically true if you have neglected tough water, which consists of harsh minerals that can connect to the piping and tank and break down the material in time.

Leakages typically indicate a new unit replacement is in order.</p>
