Our service techs install top-quality tankless water heaters in brand-new and current homes throughout the Greater Charlotte area.

With routine inspections and drain cleaning services, you can keep major debris and buildup out of your pipes and avoid bursts, obstructions, or fractures.</p>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on the majority of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. This is because the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in many cases it need to be much less water.</p>
