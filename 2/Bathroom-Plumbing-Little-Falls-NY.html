<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. Since the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The probability of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however for the most part it ought to be much less water.</p>
<p>Physical strength. Pipefitters, plumbers, and steamfitters must be able to lift and move heavy tools and materials.

Attempting to clean the pipes or treat the water with chemicals will not fix the issue, as the pipes are weakening slowly from the inside. In most cases, repiping is your only feasible choice.</p>
