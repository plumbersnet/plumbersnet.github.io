<p>Your disposer may come with a thin rubber gasket to be used under the sink flange, rather of the standard plumber's putty as detailed below.

<p>We'll reveal you three typical gas piping scenarios. We'll show you one method to make each connection, however there are other similarly genuine methods using common plumbing parts.
