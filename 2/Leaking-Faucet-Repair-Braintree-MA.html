<p>Picture residing in a home with soft water-- a house where you don't have strange films on your meals or mirrors, can lather soap easily, and do not need to fret about scaling on the within or outside of your devices. Sounds nice, does not it? What if we informed you that you could do all of that with a tankless, saltless water softener? Well, with NuvoH2O environment-friendly water systems for houses, you can.</p>
<p>It's an oddly complicated scientific process, but simple to treat. It uses salt to get rid of smells and minerals found in hard water- most commonly calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems use resin beads that draw in and attach salt ions in the softener tank. Pumps press tough water through the resin beads exchanging hardness ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>
