<p>Need loads, no matter what their usage, must be met by a properly sized supply of water, which makes up the second major component of a water system system. With appropriate tank capacity to meet variable peak load need, the supply of water source can provide a stable circulation of water. Throughout hours of low need, the water flow can be used to refill storage tanks, towers and tanks, which then supply water for emergency use and periods when demand surpasses the baseline pumping rate. A water supply source can take numerous forms, including groundwater extraction well fields, free-flowing rivers, manufactured or natural ponds, artesian springs, ocean water desalination plants, and rainwater run-off collection systems.</p>
<p>A water softener is made up of a mineral tank and a backflush tank. It collects hardness minerals within its conditioning tank and from time to time flushes them away to drain. Ion exchangers are often used for water softening. When an ion exchanger is looked for water softening, it will replace the calcium and magnesium ions in the water with other ions such as salt or potassium. The result of our advanced water softener technology is healthier, smoother water for you and your household, while still maintaining an effective flow rate.</p>
