<h3>Recent Advances in Sewer Drain Cleaning Technology in Rocky Mount VA 24151</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
