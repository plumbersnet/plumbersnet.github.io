<h3>How to Overcome Sink Drain Problems in Rice Lake WI 54868</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed estimate to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months ago. I feel that rates were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March stated depending upon the market and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
