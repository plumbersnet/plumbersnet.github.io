<p>Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses defense of the drinkable supply of water within a structure these gadgets are referred to as isolation" BFP. Again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to make sure there is an air gap, if there is no other way to supply one, then we check to see that the correct BFP device is set up. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>

<p>To ensure that the repair process succeeded, it is now time to switch on the gas and check for leakages. Repeat the process of sealing the leaks up until you are satisfied that there are no more gas leaks if there are any leakages.
