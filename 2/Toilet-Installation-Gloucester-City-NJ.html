Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak.

As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another appointment, they called him back and he stated he would not come back.
