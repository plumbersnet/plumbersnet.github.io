<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like material coated with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water streams through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>The kitchen drain can easily get clogged when mass amounts of food are launched into the waste disposal unit. This can be one of the most frustrating circumstances for property owners, but the plumbers at Winters Home Services are professionals at kitchen drain cleaning.
