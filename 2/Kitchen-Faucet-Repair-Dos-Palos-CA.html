<p>A. Typically wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>If the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is a sign the tank is stopping working and will need to be replaced. Schedule an estimate as quickly as possible and make sure nothing is near the heater that might be potentially harmed if it is in a garage and a little slow leak. Leaking hot water heater can burst triggering water damage and flooding of homes.</p>
