Continuous feed disposals are simple to run: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this kind of waste disposal unit, however, bottle caps, silverware, and other metal debris can in some cases get caught in the blades. This can damage the blades and need repairs.</p>

<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits accumulate, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits occur more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. If you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
