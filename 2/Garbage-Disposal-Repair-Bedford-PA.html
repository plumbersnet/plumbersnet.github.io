<p>We're changing a natural gas hot water heater in our presentation. The steps for replacing a propane hot water heater are exactly the same, and those for an electric hot water heater are comparable. Repeating repairs and leaks. If your water heater is over 10 years old, it has actually likely lost much of its performance; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not affordable in the long run. As a result, we advise replacing your unit if it is over ten years old.</p>
