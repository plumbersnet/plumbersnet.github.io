<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water.

The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
