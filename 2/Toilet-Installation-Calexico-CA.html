<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a practical option, particularly when simple plunging does not appear to work. Nevertheless, there are many disadvantages to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they normally contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the threat of harm to your home and family.</p>
