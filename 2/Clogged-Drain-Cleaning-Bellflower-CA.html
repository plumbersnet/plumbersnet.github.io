<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange websites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize when backwashing is total. Some water softeners will instantly switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch.
