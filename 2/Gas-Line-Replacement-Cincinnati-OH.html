<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should initially think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these components are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
