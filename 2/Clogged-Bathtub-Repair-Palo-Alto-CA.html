It is essential that only initial factory repair parts are utilized when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the maker produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was developed to use and changing the rubber from the initial factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
