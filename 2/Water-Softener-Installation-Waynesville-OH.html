<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water system. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
