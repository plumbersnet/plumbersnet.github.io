<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable television, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's DIY project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>

Additionally, you might install carbon monoxide detectors in your house.</p>
