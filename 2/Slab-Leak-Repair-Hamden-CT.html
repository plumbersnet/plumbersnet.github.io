<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Hamden CT 06514</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, because I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months ago. I feel that costs were increased because I had a "Deal". An Angie's list article from March said depending on the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
