Both will create an excellent seal (though the gasket may lead to percentages of water gathering around the flange), and what's utilized is mainly a matter of preference. Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to get rid of.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
