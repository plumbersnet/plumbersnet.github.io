<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Fairfax VA</h3>
<p>No hot water-- The lack of warm water is the biggest indication that there is something incorrect with your San Antonio hot water heater. If you aren't getting enough warm water for your shower, then you might have sediment that has developed in the system and separated the water from the heat source. If your water heater isn't doing its only job, it's time to seek advice from the professionals.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely envisioned. If you have moderately tough water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>

<h3>Drain Cleaning Techniques in Fairfax VA 22030</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, given that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) and that was just 9 months earlier. I feel that costs were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March stated depending upon the market and seriousness of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
