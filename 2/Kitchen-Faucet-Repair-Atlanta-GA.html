<p>The majority of houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather defense. As the external covering of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
