<h3>The Importance Of Drain Cleaning and How it Affects Your Home in Munford TN 38058</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, considering that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months back. I feel that rates were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list short article from March said depending on the market and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
