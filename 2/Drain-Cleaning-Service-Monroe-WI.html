<p>Please let EBMUD understand of any scenario that may require a backflow device. Often conditions on homes change that might need a backflow device, such as dealing with a boiler with additives or setting up a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than a hassle for your business, they can trigger financial losses and in some circumstances can stop your company totally. For dining establishments having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be devastating. Even in a little workplace the problems triggered by even small drain problems can cause significant problems.</p>
<p>In order to insure the appropriate operation of a backflow prevention assembly, it needs to be tested and certified upon installation and at least once a year afterwards if set up to protect form a health danger circumstance. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and local water suppliers manage these state requirements. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies have internal seals, springs, and moving parts that undergo fouling, use, or fatigue. Also, mechanical backflow preventers and air spaces can be bypassed. Therefore, all backflow prevention assemblies need to be checked periodically to ensure that they are working correctly. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies have to be evaluated with correctly adjusted gauge devices.</p>
