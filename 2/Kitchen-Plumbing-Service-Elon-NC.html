<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- destructive. For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this kind of deterioration A softener is merely catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (typically sodium or often potassium).</p>
<p>If you're working with a reliable plumber in Utah, they will normally back up their deal with a guarantee. That means if something goes wrong later, you will have somebody who can fix it without any added expenses. The alternative do-it-yourself (DIY) approach offers no such assurances, and oftentimes unless you understand a lot about plumbing, there's a pretty considerable threat that you may do more damage. When that occurs, you will probably need to call a plumber anyway to fix your errors, and chances are they will cost more and be harder than if you had simply called a professional in the first location.</p>
