I WILL SUGGEST THEM 100% for any plumbing work. they are professinal on what they do.</p>
<p>Tip: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not prevent back-pressure. I just recently had several plumbing leakages repaired and could not be happier with the prompt service I got from Parker and Sons. They are extremely experienced, friendly, fairly priced, and do quality work. I would definitely advise them to my household and everyone. I would trust them to repair any leak in the house.</p>
<p>Passive Purge - Approximately 2007, some houses were permitted to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with usage of several toilets in the home. Typically, the water supply to among the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire lawn sprinkler; upon each usage, fresh water was presented into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
