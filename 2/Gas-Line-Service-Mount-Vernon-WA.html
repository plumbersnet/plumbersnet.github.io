<h3>Residential Plumbing Services Mount Vernon WA</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable television, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY project. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>
