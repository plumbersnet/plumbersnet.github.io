<h3>Hiring The Services Of A Professional Plumbing Service Provider Fowlerville MI</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Toilet replacements and repairs are a natural part of being a homeowner. If you wait too long to call a plumber for toilet repairs, you might sustain much more costly residential or commercial property damage. Even a sluggish leak can damage your subfloors and floors - causing significant repairs and even changing the whole floor. An overruning toilet can flood your bathroom, causing unsanitary conditions, wood rot, and mold growth.
