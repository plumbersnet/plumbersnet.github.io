<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Generally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is minor, however if you have actually been advised by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet this boost can position problems.</p>
