<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are set up in areas where water might cause devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and locations with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>

<h3>Do You Need Water Heater Repair in Westwood MA 02090?</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems generally are set up in large, unheated locations, such as parking lot. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler activates due to heat, the air is launched, allowing the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is released through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
