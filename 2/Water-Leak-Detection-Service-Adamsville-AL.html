<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on most rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off.

The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or at least reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless in many cases it need to be much less water.</p>
