<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Greenwich CT 06830?</h3>
<p>Leaks - If your water heater is leaking, you may need to replace the unit. Gradually leakages can cause other issues and even cause mold to grow around the system. Get it fixed as soon as you can if you see a leak. Linking irrigation to fountains, swimming pools and garden ponds prohibited: State law and City ordinance hold that no watering system might be connected to a water fountain, swimming pool, or garden pond. These water functions might only be filled with safe and clean water. Water which has actually entered a watering system is not safe and clean.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate debris such as hard water scale, sand, grease, and silt deposits.</p>
