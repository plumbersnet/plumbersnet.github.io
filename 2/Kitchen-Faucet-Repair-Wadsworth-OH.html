<h3>Things To Know Before Hiring A Sewer Cleaning Company at Wadsworth OH 44281</h3>
<p>If you notice a smell or unpleasant smell coming from your unit, which is not uncommon, consider purchasing a flange that can seal up and cover the top of the disposal, where foul smells can leave. These flanges are widely available and easy to install, costing around $30 at home improvement or hardware shops. Switch off the water system to your house at the main line.
