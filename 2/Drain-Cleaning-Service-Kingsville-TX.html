<p>Minerals in water are what makes sure water considered hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most typical minerals discovered in water. Typically, minerals get there because groundwater will dissolve rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the remnants travel with the water until it is in your house. Water softening uses an ion exchange procedure to eliminate liquified minerals that aren't as effectively eliminated by mechanical filtration. These products are what causes hard water.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have moderately tough water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
