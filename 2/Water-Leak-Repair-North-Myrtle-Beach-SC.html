<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product covered with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits accumulate, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes. These deposits happen more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you wish to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned. It's time for a new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs.</p>
