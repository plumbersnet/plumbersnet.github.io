<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in Rutland MA 01543</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day.

This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
