<p>No other room in a house contains as numerous pipes and plumbing components as the bathroom. Look for quality materials when changing an under-sink assembly. Avoid flex pipe that can be bent into any configuration, along with flexible rubber traps. Debris can quickly catch in this type of piping while the piping's versatile nature does not supply necessary support for the drain basket. PVC assemblies are an excellent choice s they can be easily connected to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and ensure it sets prior to testing the drain.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends upon the degree of the rot.

Before you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
