After you replace your waste disposal unit, check out 100 kitchen and bath updates that damage a house's value. If you ever smell or suspect a natural gas leak, do not wait! Leave the premises right away then call 911 and Atmos Energy at 866-322-8667. Do not depend on your sense of odor alone to detect the existence of natural gas. Use all of your senses-- smell, listen or look-- to check for indications of a leak.</p>

More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in salt is minor, however if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a rigorous low salt diet this boost can present problems.</p>
