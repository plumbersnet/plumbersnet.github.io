<p>As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will build up in numerous parts of the plumbing system, a lot of frequently in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can cause low flow concerns or even stop a fixture from flowing altogether. The next typical problem that occurs with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which occurs when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so serious that it decreases the available volume of water that can flow around the system.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as hard water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>
