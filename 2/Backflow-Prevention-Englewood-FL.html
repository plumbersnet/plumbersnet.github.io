These flanges are easy and commonly readily available to install, costing around $30 in the house improvement or hardware shops. Switch off the supply of water to your house at the main line. To avoid leaks from springing during the installation process, shut off the water supply to your home. Ensure your water heater's water supply is turned off, as is the electrical energy running to the system.</p>
