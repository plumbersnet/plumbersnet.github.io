<p>Finally, the most sophisticated and complicated backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 separately operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. Throughout basic water flows at design pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if costly) device is best utilized in vital locations where cross contamination could be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
