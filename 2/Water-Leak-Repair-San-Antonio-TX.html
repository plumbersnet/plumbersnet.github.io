<h3>Warning Signs of Sewer Mainline Pipe Clogs in San Antonio TX 78228</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
