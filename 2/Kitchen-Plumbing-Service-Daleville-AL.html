<h3>Getting Blocked Sewer Drainage Solutions at Daleville AL 36322</h3>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and lose down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not really the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they decrease your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there will not go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
