<p>Video cameras are one of the most important tools in the plumbing service.

The pipes themselves need to be at least a 1/2" in diameter to provide adequate flow.</p>
<p>Downspout Drains: These clog with leaves and debris and can stop working to carry water from roof seamless gutters away from your house or business when not correctly preserved. Even if you take great care of your drains by covering them and preventing pouring any liquid fat, oil, and grease down them, often clogs are unavoidable. If you have a clogged drain, it is extremely important that you do not try to unclog it yourself due to the fact that this might potentially lead to a big leak and more costly repairs.</p>
