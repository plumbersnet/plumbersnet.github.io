<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of many repairs, there are plenty of other small toilet parts that ought to also be well maintained to help avoid leakages and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to break and harden or merely be so crushed that it does not fill the area along with it used to, and you end up with water all over the location. Just like with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become so worn or rusty that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly advise also changing your gasket and your bolt set to make certain whatever remains in good shape.</p>
