<p>Examine the washer for wear or fractures when you eliminate the cap to flush out the valve. Changing a bad washer is easy and cheap. But finding the right washer might not be. The most common washers are often offered at home centers and hardware shops. Other designs can be tough to find. If you choose to hunt for a washer, remove it and take it to the shop to find a match. Plumbers normally replace the entire fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>

<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange websites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. Once backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
