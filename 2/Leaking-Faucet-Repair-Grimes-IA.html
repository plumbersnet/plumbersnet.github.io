<p>PEX is made from a versatile piping product that is affordable and simple to install and is resistant to acidic substances. Nevertheless, it can not be used outside because it is damaged by UV light, and it can not be directly connected to a water heater. Gradually, sinks can also get dings, chips and scratches that can ruin their visual appeal. Gauges in porcelain sinks can start to rust.

<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on certain new sinks, but these will be labeled to that effect. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. When you tighten the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel.
