<p>We're changing a gas hot water heater in our presentation. The steps for changing a propane hot water heater are exactly the same, and those for an electric water heater are similar. Repeating leaks and repairs.

<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be connected to the disposer utilizing the plate, gasket and screws originally planned for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package only consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The successive 90 ° turns in such a setup can lead to inappropriate drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you might have the ability to cut off its elbow and use the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>

<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one should first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these components are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
