<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc attached to a climatic vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This sets off the disc to open, permitting air to enter the valve and bring back pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric requirement. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
