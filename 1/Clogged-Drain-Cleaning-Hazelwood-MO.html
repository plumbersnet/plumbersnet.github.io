<p>It's important to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Changes in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt an appropriately functioning RPZ assembly to periodically discharge percentages of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in areas subject to water damage. Sufficient drainage should likewise be offered.</p>
<p>Observing high water pressure at plumbing fixtures in your house? Water pressure in the house is similar to high blood pressure in the body - it needs to be managed to keep the system healthy.
