<p>Do you prepare to utilize fertigation (fertilizer injected into the irrigation water), apply fertilizer, pesticides (such as for pest control), or apply anything besides pure water using your watering system? This includes items labeled as organic", natural", and safe". This also consists of the safe" mosquito control products applied by sprinklers and misters.

<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The current dual flush HET provided by Bonney will use an average of 1.1 gallons per flush.

Appropriate care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
