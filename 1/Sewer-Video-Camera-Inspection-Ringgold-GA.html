<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The current dual flush HET provided by Bonney will use an average of 1.1 gallons per flush.

Appropriate care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
