<p>A water softener eliminates minerals that produce water solidity, among the most common water quality problems a house owner encounters. Difficult water destroys home appliances, leaves cloudy soap residue across kitchen areas and bathrooms, and dries hair and skin. With over 85% of the United States depending on hard water for their cleaning, bathing, and cooking, water softeners serve an essential function. A water softener conserves you from replacing too soon messed up water heaters, flaky faucet heads, and hours and hours of cleaning up soapy residue. Buying a water softener saves you cash, time, and energy, and protects your home and your property.</p>

<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
