At the least, it would have been a really costly alternative.</p>
<p>Then attach the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if relevant).

<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will restore on an established schedule and then go back to service.

Such designs are convenient if you have a rising and falling water utilize schedule.</p>
