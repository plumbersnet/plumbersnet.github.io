<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
<p>You also need to invest in a backflow valve if you discover your water has an unusual flow, color, odor or taste. A plumbing professional can determine whether the problem with your faucet is a quick fix or the outcome of other concerns in your home's plumbing system. More complex problems with water temperature or pressure may need replacing the hot water heater, which typically costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capability and type.</p>
