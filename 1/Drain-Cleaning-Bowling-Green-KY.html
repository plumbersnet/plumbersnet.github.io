<h3>Helpful Tips For Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Bowling Green KY</h3>
<p>When the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure. It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on really gradually to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to make sure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close appropriately. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
