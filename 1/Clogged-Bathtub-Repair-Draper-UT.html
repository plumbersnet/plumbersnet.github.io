<p>Physical Damage: Water tank and water heater repair from physical damage such as leaks or cracks are also common occurrences. Kenny came out and did an amazing job unclogging my storm drain. He detected the problem and had the ability to come back and jet it out. Saved me the time and cash of ripping it all out and replacing it. He offered tips to help in the future, was extremely professional, and will be used once again if need be. Highly recommended.</p>
<p>Throughout regeneration, the water softener will take the salt water solution into the softener tank and the ion exchange process takes place once again, just this time in reverse. At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the entire system.
