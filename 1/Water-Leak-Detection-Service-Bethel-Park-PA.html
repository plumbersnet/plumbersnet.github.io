This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather condition protection. As the external coating of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
