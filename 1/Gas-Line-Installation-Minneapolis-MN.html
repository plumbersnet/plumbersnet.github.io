<p>Oregon state laws governing water systems need backflow prevention assemblies to be installed on water services where cross connections can not be eliminated. Backflow assemblies are required to be set up on the water service connections to all fire sprinkler and landscape lawn sprinkler. The law also requires backflow assemblies in commercial facilities such as health centers and mortuaries, along with commercial facilities.</p>
<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
