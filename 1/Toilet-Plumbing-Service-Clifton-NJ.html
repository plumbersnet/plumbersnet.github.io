<h3>An Easy Approach To Find A Reliable Plumber Clifton NJ</h3>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Toilet repairs and replacements are a natural part of being a property owner. You could sustain much more costly residential or commercial property damage if you wait too long to call a plumber for toilet repairs. Even a slow leak can ruin your subfloors and floorings - resulting in significant repairs and even replacing the whole floor.
