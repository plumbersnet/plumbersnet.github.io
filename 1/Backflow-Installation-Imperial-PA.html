<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and squander down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not really the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a downward angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
<p>Setting up a brand-new gas line in the kitchen will normally range from $300 to $800 depending on the length of the pipe needed. If you're converting your home to natural gas, or if the current line is at capability, expect to spend $2,000 or more.
