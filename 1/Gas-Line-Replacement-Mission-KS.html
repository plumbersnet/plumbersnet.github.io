<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Mission KS</h3>
<p>Most homes or structures that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather defense. As the external finish of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Insecticide from garden tubes: The extremely poisonous insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water system. An extermination company worker had left one end of a garden hose in a barrel of diluted insecticide and the other linked to an external home hose bibb (outside spigot). When the water supply system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was sucked back through your house into the water system.</p>
