<p>A freshly installed water heater must not produce strange sounds, however it will begin to generate rumbling sounds as it ages. The noises get louder in time as the heater runs to heat up the water. Things intensify dramatically for families with a high demand for hot water. The factors for the noises can be the buildup of sediments in the tank which need to be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement may be required.</p>
