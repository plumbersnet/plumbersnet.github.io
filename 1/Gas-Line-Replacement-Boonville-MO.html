<p>Need loads, no matter what their use, need to be fulfilled by a sufficiently sized water system, which constitutes the second major part of a water system system. With appropriate storage tank capacity to meet variable peak load need, the water system source can supply a stable circulation of water. Throughout hours of low need, the water flow can be used to fill up storage towers, tanks and cisterns, which then supply water for emergency usage and durations when need surpasses the baseline pumping rate. A water supply source can take many kinds, consisting of groundwater extraction well fields, free-flowing rivers, natural or man-made ponds, artesian springs, ocean water desalination plants, and rainwater run-off collection systems.</p>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, doesn't the water pressure in the water supply keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a frequent event, but it does occur more often than you think!

An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or connect a brand-new pipe. This makes construction projects easily the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire combating is another typical reason for backflow. Fire engine use substantial pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding communities.</p>
