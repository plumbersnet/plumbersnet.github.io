<p>Plastic pipe remains in large use for domestic water supply and drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe. Principal types include: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not become practical to make up until 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. developed an approach to plasticize PVC, making it simpler to process. PVC pipe began to be produced in the 1940s and was in broad usage for Drain-Waste-Vent piping during the reconstruction of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics producers in Western Europe and Japan started producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe. The approach for producing cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) was also developed in the 1950s. Plastic supply pipes have become significantly typical, with a range of fittings and products utilized.</p>
