The presence of excess iron or hydrogen sulfide can inhibit the efficiency of a water-softening unit. Installation of the iron-removal equipment might be required (see the NDSU publication Iron and Manganese" (AE1030) Water test outcomes will assist make that decision.</p>
<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on the majority of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. This is since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in most cases it need to be much less water.</p>
