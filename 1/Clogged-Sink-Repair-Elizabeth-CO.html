<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits collect, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits occur more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up if you want to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs.</p>
