<p>You may have heard stories about a hot water heater taking off inside a house or organisation! It is important to understand that a plugged temperature level and pressure relief valve on your hot water heater can turn your hot water heater into a harmful time bomb. The age of your hot water heater. A conventional tank water heater normally lasts anywhere from 8-12 years prior to needing a replacement, while a tankless hot water heater can last up to 20 with appropriate maintenance and care.
