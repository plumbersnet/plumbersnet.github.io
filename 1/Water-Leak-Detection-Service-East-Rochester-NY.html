<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when searching for a practical service, especially when basic plunging does not appear to work. However, there are many disadvantages to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they normally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life.
