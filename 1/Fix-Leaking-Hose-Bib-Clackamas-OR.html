Other great options are overload security, which switches off the motor if it begins to get too hot; an auto-reverse feature to prevent jamming; and a dishwasher-drain connection so food particles from the unclean meals get ground up in the disposal.

Water pressure in the home is similar to high blood pressure in the body - it needs to be controlled to keep the system healthy. When unregulated water pressure causes damage to the plumbing system, this can cause emergency plumbing calls, like flooding. Having a water pressure regulator installed is MUCH more economical than mold removal or changing flooring or drywall! So we recommend repairing or setting up water pressure regulators to protect your entire house.</p>
