<p>Leakages - If your water heater is leaking, you may need to replace the system. With time leaks can cause other concerns and even cause mold to grow around the unit. Get it fixed as soon as you can if you observe a leak. Linking watering to water fountains, swimming pools and garden ponds prohibited: State law and City regulation hold that no irrigation system might be connected to a water fountain, swimming pool, or garden pond. These water functions may only be filled with potable water. Water which has actually gone into an irrigation system is not potable.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems typically are installed in large, unheated locations, such as parking garages. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is released, enabling the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is released through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
