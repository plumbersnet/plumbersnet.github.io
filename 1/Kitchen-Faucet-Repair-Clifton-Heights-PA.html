Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common kind of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
