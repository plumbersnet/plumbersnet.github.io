<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively thought of. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
