<p>Changing your flapper may require slightly different actions than we reveal (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job if you have an unusual flush valve. To find an ideal replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water prior to getting rid of the flapper.) You may not find an identical match, however chances are you'll find one of the same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
