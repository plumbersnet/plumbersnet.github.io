<p>Whether replacing an old one or putting one in for the very first time, there are a couple of things worth knowing about waste disposal unit installation. Typically, it will cost from $45 to $197 to repair a toilet yourself or in between $130 and $310 to have professional repairs done by a plumber. The per hour charge for a plumbing contractor is $72 to $82, which does not consist of materials or parts. Rates depend on the precise repair required, where you live, employing a plumber vs. hiring a handyman, and whether you can DIY it.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet blockages are not unusual, but if your toilet is blocking more than 3 times a month, there's a bigger problem to take a look at. If your toilet is fairly brand-new, you may need to switch bathroom tissue or work with a plumber to clear an obstruction from the drain. The National Contractor License Service maintains a list of each state's professional licensing agency where you can search for your state's licensing details. Check the list of state licensing firms to learn whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also keeps a licensing tool to examine state licensing requirements.</p>
