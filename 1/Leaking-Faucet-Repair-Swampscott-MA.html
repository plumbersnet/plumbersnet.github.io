<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
