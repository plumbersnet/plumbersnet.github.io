<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
