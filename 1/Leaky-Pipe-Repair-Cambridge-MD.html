<p>All you actually need to do is (CAREFULLY!) when you have actually found the trip lever you want eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your brand-new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it. Keep in mind that due to the fact that of the method a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the proper way. When you've secured the journey lever and are prepared to link your flapper, make sure you have actually got simply enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
