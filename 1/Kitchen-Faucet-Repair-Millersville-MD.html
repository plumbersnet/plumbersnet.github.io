Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
