A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the different metals.
