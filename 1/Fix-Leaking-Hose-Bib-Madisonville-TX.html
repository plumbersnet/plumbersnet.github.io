<p>Changing your flapper might need slightly different actions than we show (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job if you have an unusual flush valve. To discover a suitable replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Switch off the water before getting rid of the flapper.)
