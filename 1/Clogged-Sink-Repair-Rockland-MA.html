<p>Lastly, the most sophisticated and complicated backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device includes no less than five separately operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other four. During standard water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if costly) device is best used in crucial locations where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
<p>Galvanized piping is accountable for at least half of the plumbing emergencies that we encounter in your houses around the Bay Area.
