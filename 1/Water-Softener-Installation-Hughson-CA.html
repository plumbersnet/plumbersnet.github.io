<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial inventory of backflow valves and associated devices includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Such possible health risks are worrying, but they aren't the only problem. Backflow can likewise be extremely expensive to remediate. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mentions that the typical backflow event takes nearly 500 hours to fix at a cost of $14,800. Have you ever questioned exactly what is a water softener? After all, isn't all water soft? Fair point. However water softeners were produced to fight a remarkably common problem: hard water.</p>
<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water dishwasher, boiler, and heater, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits. At first, these little deposits are safe, but gradually they develop and eventually clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can significantly restrict the water flow, which puts undue pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>

<p>Backflow preventers are likewise needed by the plumbing code.

If you are employing somebody to plant for you, make certain to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that she or he will also know the locations to prevent. Your line will be simple to recognize if you have a clean-out.</p>
