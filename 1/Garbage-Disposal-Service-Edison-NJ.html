<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather sensible. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
