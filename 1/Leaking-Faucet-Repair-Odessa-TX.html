<p>Downsides to be knowledgeable about is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that remains in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater. Likewise, hybrids require approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to record adequate heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to discharge the condensate.</p>
<p>The concern of leakage can be attributed to any number of aspects which can vary from the tank is old and worn, to over-pressurization, along with poor maintenance. The water heater tank need to have some room to account for the growth that happens when heating the water. The thermal expansion requires to escape, thus the need for a growth tank to help regulate the pressure. The force put in by the growth taking location when boiling the water triggers the reservoir to break and begin leaking if the tank is old and used out. The solution for this is to replace the hot water heater unit.</p>
