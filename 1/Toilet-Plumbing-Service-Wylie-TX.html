<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Wylie TX</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY project. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who understands the drill.</p>

Service lines which originate from private property and feed into the main line are a normal area for breaks or leakages.
