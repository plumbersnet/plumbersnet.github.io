<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable supply of water. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity.
