<p>Disposers fasten to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most common. To get rid of the disposer, support it from listed below and turn the large, 3-tab mounting ring on top counterclockwise till the unit falls away. Eliminate the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening the three bolts and spying off the keeping ring. Press the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
