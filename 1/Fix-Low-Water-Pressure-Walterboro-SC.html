<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits accumulate, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits take place more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
