<h3>Plumbing - Leaky Faucets and Water Waste in El Segundo CA 90245</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one ought to first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
