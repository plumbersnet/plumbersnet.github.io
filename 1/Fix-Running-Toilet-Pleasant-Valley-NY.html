<p>Minerals in water are what makes certain water considered hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most common minerals found in water. Normally, minerals get there due to the fact that groundwater will liquify rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the remnants take a trip with the water up until it is in your house. Water softening utilizes an ion exchange process to eliminate liquified minerals that aren't as efficiently gotten rid of by mechanical filtration. These materials are what triggers hard water.</p>

<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this kind of corrosion A softener is merely catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (generally sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
