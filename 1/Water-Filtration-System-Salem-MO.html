<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak.

As soon as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another visit, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
