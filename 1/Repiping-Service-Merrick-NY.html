<p>When you drop something down your drain or when you clean out a couple of hairs from the tub, it might seem like just a small nuisance.

I just recently needed to replace the hot water heater in my home and it was only 6 years of ages. Conventional water heaters with a tank need to usually last 10 to 15 years. I also have a dishwasher in my kitchen that has not been utilized in more than two years. Washing dishes is my least preferred chore, particularly without the aid of a dishwasher.</p>
