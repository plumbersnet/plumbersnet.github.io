When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the sprinkler system can become contaminated. There is capacity for the infected water to become a health risk if permitted to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected frequently for efficiency, as well as checked each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>

<p>Water fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions should have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers.

Any backflow preventer installed on a fountain or garden pond must be evaluated upon installation and then every year.</p>

Typically, the water supply to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire lawn sprinkler; upon each usage, fresh water was introduced into the fire sprinkler system.</p>
