We now have cleaned up and examined the components parts, replaced the rubber repair parts, re-assembled the parts and the rubber parts back into their elements, cleaned up the body and the seats and flushed the incoming water line. We are now prepared to start the re-assembly process. Some designs need the components to be removed in a particular order. These assemblies will also need the re-assembly in a specific order. Lots of components can not be re-installed into the body unless the test cocks are left open. As each part is put back into the body, it is very important to put them back in the appropriate place. It is also important that as they are positioned back into the body, that no contaminant is connected on the elements or mistakenly positioned in the body. The components must be put so that the guides have the ability to maintain their designed tolerances.</p>
<p>Then connect the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if appropriate). If your unit is outlet-ready-- pay attention to this part-- make certain your disposal switch is in the off" position prior to you plug the brand-new system in.
