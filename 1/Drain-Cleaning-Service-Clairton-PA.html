<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
