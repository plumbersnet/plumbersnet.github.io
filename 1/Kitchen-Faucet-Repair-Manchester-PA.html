<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits build up, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits take place more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up if you desire to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
