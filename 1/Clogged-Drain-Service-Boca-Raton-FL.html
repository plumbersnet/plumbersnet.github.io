<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede versus the needed direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the community supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being infected. If allowed to return to the water system, there is potential for the infected water to end up being a health threat. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for efficiency, as well as inspected every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
