<p>Most need for plumbers will stem from brand-new building and construction and the need to repair and maintain plumbing systems in existing residences and other structures. Work of sprinklerfitters is expected to increase as states continue to embrace modifications to constructing codes that require using fire suppression systems. It's most likely that the new unit will fit the existing bracket if there was an existing disposal attached to the sink currently. If not-- or if there is no disposal currently in location-- start by eliminating the old drain. A lot of drains are attached to the sink by a big nut beneath the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen.</p>
