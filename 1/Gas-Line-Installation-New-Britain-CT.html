<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option.
