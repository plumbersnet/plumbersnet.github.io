In many cases, the homeowner is responsible for keeping the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is responsible for keeping the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>Considering that commercial plumbing concerns have the capability to cause such financial loss and pricey property damage, it is essential to align yourself with a company that has the experience and personnel to make a distinction.
