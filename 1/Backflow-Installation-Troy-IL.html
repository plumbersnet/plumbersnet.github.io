<p>Backflow is water streaming in the opposite direction from its normal circulation. IRWD's safe and clean water system is created to keep the water flowing to you. When hydraulic conditions within any water system deviate from "typical," the instructions of water flow can be reversed. This produces a backflow condition and the capacity for infected water getting in the drinkable water circulation system.</p>
<p>Sadly, when water is completely removed of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it typically ends up being corrosive.
