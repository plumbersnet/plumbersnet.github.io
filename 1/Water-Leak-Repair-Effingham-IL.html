<p>Drawbacks to be familiar with is that hybrid hot water heater need to be set up in an area that stays in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need approximately 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, due to the fact that the heatpump is on top of the hot water heater. Also, hybrids need approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to catch sufficient heat from the air, and a drain in close proximity to release the condensate.</p>
<p>Physical strength. Pipefitters, steamfitters, and plumbers need to be able to lift and move heavy tools and materials. Idea: Place a heavy object such as the disposal itself in the sink to weigh down the flange and keep it from moving during installation.

Attempting to clean the pipes or deal with the water with chemicals will not fix the issue, as the pipes are degrading gradually from the within. In most cases, repiping is your only viable choice.</p>
