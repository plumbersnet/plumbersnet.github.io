<p>Polybutylene used inside your house can be discovered near the hot water heater or coming out of the walls to feed sinks or toilets. Warning: some plumbers installed stub outs" of copper when leaving the wall. Just because copper is showing does not imply you do not have polybutylene pipes. You might have to make a little hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits accumulate, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to go through your pipes.

It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs.</p>
