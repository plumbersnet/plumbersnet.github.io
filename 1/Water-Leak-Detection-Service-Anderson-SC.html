<h3>Residential Water Heater Repair and Replacement at Anderson SC 29621</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, considering that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months earlier. I feel that prices were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list short article from March said depending on the market and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
<p>As we stated, a waste disposal unit has a lifespan. Typically they will last between ten and twelve years. So, if you observe any of the following indications when you have actually had your disposal for about this amount of time, then you are best about ready for a brand-new one. An air gap on a pool fill up pipe must be quickly available for inspection and meet the strict definition of an air gap as defined in plumbing codes and state regulations. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and area should be suggested on pool building plans.</p>
