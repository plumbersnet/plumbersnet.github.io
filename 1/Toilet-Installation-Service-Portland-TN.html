<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services Portland TN</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
<p>Replacing your flapper might require somewhat various steps than we show (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job if you have an uncommon flush valve. To discover an ideal replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Switch off the water before removing the flapper.) You may not discover a similar match, but chances are you'll find one of the very same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
