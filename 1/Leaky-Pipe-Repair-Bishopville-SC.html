Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return due to the fact that he had another consultation.
