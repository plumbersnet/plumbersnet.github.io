<p>CPM Plumbing focuses on speedy service, precise troubleshooting, and accuracy repairs so your service never has to suffer from downtime. One thing to know about gas lines is they can be incredibly dangerous if there is a leak. While gas leaks are rare, you need to leave the structure immediately if you observe an odor like rotten eggs in your home. A gas leak can have nearly instant effects on those exposed to it, and it can even be fatal. Get out of the house and call us immediately if you have actually got a gas pipe leaking.</p>
<p>A license is also needed to reconnect electrical or gas service to a house. If the energy has actually been shut off to a residential structure for 6 successive months, reconnect authorizations are needed. The license cost is $99.00 which covers administrative and inspection expenses. If you are installing water or gas piping, an illustration needs to be submitted that determines the size and length of all piping. Include the Gas Piping Design template found below with your application.</p>
