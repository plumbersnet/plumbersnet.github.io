The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and benefit back siphonage just for non-health danger or health danger conditions. They need to be set up downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on an irrigation system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system..
