<p>Once the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure. It is essential that the plumbing system be turned on extremely slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system ought to be checked to guarantee no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close effectively when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily trigger thousands of dollars in water damage, disrupt your household for weeks, and toss your remodel way off schedule.
