<p>In truth, reverse circulation testing designed to guarantee that backflow preventers avoid backflow was removed from NFPA 25 in 2011. While NFPA acknowledges that backflow remains a legitimate health issue, it thinks about avoiding it outside the scope of NFPA 25. Rather, NFPA presumes that local or state requirements will ensure that backflow preventers are appropriately tested by certified personnel.</p>
<p>Passive Purge - As much as 2007, some homes were allowed to bypass a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of several toilets in the house. Typically, the water supply to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire sprinkler system; upon each usage, fresh water was introduced into the fire lawn sprinkler.</p>
