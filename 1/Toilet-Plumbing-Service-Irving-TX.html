Also, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is originating from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>

The best way to tighten them is with a set of locking pliers. Wrenches use up excessive area and need a broad swing angle, which might be difficult to obtain in small spaces.</p>
