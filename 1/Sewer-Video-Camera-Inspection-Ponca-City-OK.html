<p>Hard water use might affect the performance of household devices. When heated up, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the warm water heater. A big scale accumulation slows the heating process and needs more energy to heat water. Hot water heater with large build-ups of mineral accumulation will have a shorter life expectancy. Scale deposits also build up to plug plumbing fixtures and build up in other devices such as coffee pots and dishwashers, therefore affecting their efficiency.</p>

A Backflow Prevention Device is used to safeguard portable water materials from contamination or pollution due to backflow. In water system systems, water is normally maintained at a significant pressure to enable water to circulation.</p>
<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
