During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
