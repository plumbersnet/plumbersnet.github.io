This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather protection. As the outer finishing of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
