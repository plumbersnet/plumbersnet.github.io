Most of the times, the property owner is accountable for keeping the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is responsible for keeping the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>

<h3>Helpful Tips For Selecting A Reputable, Budget Friendly Plumber Charleston MO</h3>
<p>The brand-new inlets and outlets on the tank do not constantly line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if required. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Photo 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You may have to increase or decrease the vent size to ensure the best draft. CAUTION: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The consecutive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can cause inappropriate drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
