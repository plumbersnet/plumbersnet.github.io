<h3>Sewer and Drain Cleaning Tips in Fairfield CT 06824</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, considering that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months earlier. I feel that rates were increased because I had a "Offer". An Angie's list short article from March stated depending on the market and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
