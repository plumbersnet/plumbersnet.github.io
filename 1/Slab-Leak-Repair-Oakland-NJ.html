<p>The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, however it doesn't grind up food, this means the flywheel is stuck. Try releasing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the correct size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit.

<p>Testing should be finished by a contractor registered with the Cross Connection Control workplace. The contractor needs to have a legitimate, current plumbing license, existing insurance coverage, backflow preventer testing certification, and presently adjusted test kit.
