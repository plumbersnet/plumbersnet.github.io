Remember that since of the method a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the appropriate way. When you have actually secured the journey lever and are all set to link your flapper, ensure you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the method when you lower on the trip lever.</p>
