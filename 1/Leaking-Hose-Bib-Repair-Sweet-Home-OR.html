<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Sweet Home OR</h3>
<p>Most homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather security. As the external coating of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>If the water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is an indication the tank is failing and will need to be changed. Schedule a price quote as quickly as possible and guarantee nothing is near the heater that might be possibly damaged if it is in a garage and a small sluggish leak. Leaking hot water heater can burst triggering water damage and flooding of houses.</p>
