<p>To connect a power cable to the new unit, get rid of the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and sign up with the colored wires discovered inside with their counterparts in the cable, using wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the unit. This can be done at any point prior to installation.

<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet in Loudon TN 37774</h3>
<p>City of Bellingham checks backflow assemblies upon installation and performs regular re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies should be tested by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report need to be supplied to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste better. The minerals in hard water can trigger a bad smell and taste. It eliminates the mineral content to produce odorless drinking water that tastes good when you add a water softener.</p>
<p>Warning: If utilized on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless for the most part it should be much less water.</p>
