Principal types include: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not end up being useful to make until 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. developed an approach to plasticize PVC, making it easier to process. PVC pipe began to be made in the 1940s and was in broad use for Drain-Waste-Vent piping during the restoration of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics makers in Western Europe and Japan began producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe.
