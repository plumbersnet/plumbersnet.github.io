<h3>How To Keep A Blocked Toilet From Becoming A Plumbing Catastrophe in Frederick MD 21702</h3>

I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, because I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) and that was only 9 months ago. I feel that prices were increased because I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March stated depending on the marketplace and seriousness of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
