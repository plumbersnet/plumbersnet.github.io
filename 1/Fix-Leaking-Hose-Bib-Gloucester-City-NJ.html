<p>Backflow is water streaming in the opposite direction from its regular circulation. IRWD's drinkable water supply is designed to keep the water flowing to you.

Depending upon the circulation capacity, area and age of the pipe system, these pipelines are made from a range of products: polyvinyl chloride (PVC), high density polyethylene (HDPE), cast iron, ductile iron, copper, steel, asbestos cement, and even smaller-diameter reinforced concrete.</p>
