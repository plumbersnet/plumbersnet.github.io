Therefore, softened water must also be destructive, ideal? This is a fallacy due to the fact that naturally soft water tends to be destructive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening triggers neither of these conditions.</p>

<p>Reverse osmosis utilizes an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to get rid of osmotic pressure and eliminate water particles from the solution with hardness ions. The membrane has pores big enough to admit water particles for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is without hardness ions with no other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
