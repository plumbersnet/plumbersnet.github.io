<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
