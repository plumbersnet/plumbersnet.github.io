<p>These valves have a lot of versatility. They're the least pricey of the backflow prevention choices, but they likewise supply the least quantity of defense. An atmospheric vacuum breaker, also called an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a drifting disc. When pressurized and drops to allow air to go into the downstream piping when depressurized, this disc seals and increases off the air inlet.</p>
<p>Prior to setting up, your professional will turn off water and electrical power to the area. Next, the old sink flange is gotten rid of and cleaned of any putty residue.
