<h3>Plumber Work Scope And Its Specialization Beaufort NC</h3>
<p>A. Usually wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>To make positioning a toilet much easier, brand-new toilet bolts are extra long. That means you have to cut off the protruding ends later on with a hacksaw. But very first link the water line, flush the toilet a number of times and look for leaks. Leaving the bolts uncut till you've done these final checks lets you easily get rid of and reset the toilet if you find any problems.</p>
