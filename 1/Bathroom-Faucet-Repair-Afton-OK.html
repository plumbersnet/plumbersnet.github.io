If you have an unusual flush valve, finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job. To find a suitable replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Switch off the water prior to removing the flapper.) You might not discover an identical match, but chances are you'll locate among the same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
