If your energy bills are increasing, a brand-new, higher efficiency water heater can bring them back down. All that has to be done is blocking the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open up the bypass valve, permitting difficult water to stream to the storage tank and household taps. After that the softener can be detached, transferred to its new place and placed there.</p>
