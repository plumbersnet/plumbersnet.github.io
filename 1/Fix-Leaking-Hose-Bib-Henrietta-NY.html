<p>Safeguard your home from leaks. When you need a water heater replacement, there are numerous things that you must consider to help you decide.

<p>A testable backflow prevention device has two check valves-- basically two layers of security. The device enables water to push the check valves open when water is coming into the building, but closes them shut when water attempts to go the incorrect way. There are 2 various kinds of testable backflow prevention devices that are commonly specified-- a lowered pressure zone backflow device and a check backflow device.
