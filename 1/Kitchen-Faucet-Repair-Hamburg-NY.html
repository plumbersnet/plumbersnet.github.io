<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when looking for a feasible service, specifically when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are lots of downsides to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they normally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the risk of harm to your house and household.</p>
