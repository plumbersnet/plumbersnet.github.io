<p>Passive Purge - As much as 2007, some homes were enabled to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with use of several toilets in the home.

<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts must be eliminated and replaced with brand-new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is important that just initial factory repair parts are utilized.
