Take your brand-new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Keep in mind that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the right way. When you've secured the trip lever and are ready to link your flapper, make sure you've got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
