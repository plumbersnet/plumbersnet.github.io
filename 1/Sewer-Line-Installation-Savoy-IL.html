<p>The labor costs for disposal installation are mostly time associated. If whatever is all set, in great condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or more of time. If things need to be modified, changed, or moved to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the variety of hours needed and therefore the overall expenses. The majority of plumbers charge in between $45 and $65 per hour, with most disposal setups running $50 per hour for three hours overall, making the labor expenses roughly $150.</p>
