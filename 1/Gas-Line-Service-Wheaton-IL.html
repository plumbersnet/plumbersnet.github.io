<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Wheaton IL</h3>
<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your house's equivalent of significant surgery, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with often. When your water lines are repiped, it just suggests old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with brand-new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing frequent and major leakages, you could be in need of water line repiping. We find that repiping can actually be the more affordable and better long-lasting service if you do have frequent leaks.</p>
<p>This style water heater might make the most sense for you if you have a large bathtub or more that 2 bathrooms. There are some installation factors to consider, especially around sizing the gas line and setting up the flue vent, however with the capability for a 50-gallon tank to create more hot water than a standard 80-gallon tank, these things are pretty special. High-efficiency storage is a great alternative for space heating hydronic alternatives too.</p>
