<p>You will have the ability to request the date and time of the inspection on the TSE license application. The LADBS application should be filed and spent for at least 2 (2) service days prior to the date of the occasion, AND, after you have acquired all other needed approvals or clearances from all other agencies. Waste disposal unit can be made from either aluminum or stainless steel. Aluminum is less expensive however more vulnerable to leaking and corrosion.

<p>Warning: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts off. Since the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The likelihood of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in many cases it should be much less water.</p>
