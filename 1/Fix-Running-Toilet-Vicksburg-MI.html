<h3>Pipe Cleaning in Vicksburg Michigan</h2>
<p>Numerous house owners will observe a clog and right away reach for a bottle of store-bought, chemical drain cleaner. While this kind of chemical may finish the job, it's in fact quite damaging to your pipes. Chemical drain cleaners often use lye as the active ingredient. Lye is created to penetrate clogs and dissolve them, but it also eats through your pipes and creates weak points that are susceptible to rupture.</p>
<p>If your pipes are older than these standards, it doesn't necessarily suggest they need to be replaced. Properly maintained pipes may last longer, and badly preserved ones or those in locations with tough water (implying it has high mineral material), might fail quicker, states Passaic, N.J., plumber Joseph Gove, who provided the life-span estimates.</p>
