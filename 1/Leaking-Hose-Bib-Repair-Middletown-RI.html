The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage just for non-health risk or health hazard conditions. They should be set up downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on a watering system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It needs to likewise be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local officials, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet).
