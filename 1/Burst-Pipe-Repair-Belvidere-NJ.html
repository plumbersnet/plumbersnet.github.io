<p>Call us today for more information about our drain services. We're readily available for same-day visits! Our team is waiting at (800) 259-7705. Roll plumber's putty in between your hands into a rope the size of a pencil and wrap it around the lip of the kitchen sink drain opening. Press the kitchen sink strainer strongly down into the putty, add the rubber gasket, friction ring and locknut under the sink, and retighten the locknut.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile water supply line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For an excellent seal, hold the hose so it aims straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can in fact trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If needed, check for leaks and tighten them a bit more.</p>
