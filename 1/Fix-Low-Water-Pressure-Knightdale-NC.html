<p>As a locally-owned company, stability and duty are exceptionally important to building a track record for excellence. Keep in mind: The disposer outlet should be above the drain line coming out of the wall. If it isn't, you'll need to either select a smaller sized disposer, or modify the plumbing to accommodate the brand-new setup. Nasty odors.
