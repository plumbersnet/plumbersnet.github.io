<h3>How To Pick Good 24 Hour Emergency Plumbers For Pipe Video Inspections Owasso OK</h3>
<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank don't always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to balance out each line if required. Likewise replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Image 6). Vent sizes are sized according to the heat output of the water heater. You may have to increase or reduce the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CARE: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile water supply line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless-steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can really cause leaks or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Check for leakages and tighten them a bit more if needed.</p>
