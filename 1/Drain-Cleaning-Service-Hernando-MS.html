<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively pictured. If you have moderately hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
