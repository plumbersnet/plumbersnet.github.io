<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another visit, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
