When you experience clogs in several drains at once in your home, then that normally implies that your main sewer line is backing up.

Comparing the test results from the fixed backflow prevention assembly to the makers flow chart is essential to ensure it was repaired correctly. An effectively fixed assembly needs to provide years of defense.</p>
