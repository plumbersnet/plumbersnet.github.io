Eliminate it and take it to the store to find a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers generally replace the whole fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
<p>When you've found the trip lever you want, all you truly need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and protect it. Remember that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the correct way. When you have actually protected the journey lever and are all set to hook up your flapper, make certain you have actually got simply enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing tightly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the method when you lower on the trip lever.</p>
