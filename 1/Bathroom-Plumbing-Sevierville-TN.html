<p>The typical cost of a batch feed waste disposal unit is $100-$ 350 nationwide, depending upon the size and design. They are safer to use than constant feed disposals, however are not suggested for households that generate a lot of food waste. Instead of a switch, the batch feed waste disposal unit is activated by putting a stopper in the sink drain.</p>
<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. Because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system, this is. The likelihood of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however most of the times it need to be much less water.</p>
