<p>If there are any lead pipes in the house, find out. Residences that were developed prior to 1986 often have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how helpful, is an ecological contaminant (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in houses that is not lead based). You may not want to live in a home that has lead pipes if you have children.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no close-by utilities or obstructions, digging through and replacing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining could conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a bucket under the P-trap and disconnect the drains. Then remove the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>
