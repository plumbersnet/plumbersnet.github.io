<p>Finally, the most complicated and advanced backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five independently operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout basic water flows at style pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if expensive) device is best utilized in vital areas where cross contamination might be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
