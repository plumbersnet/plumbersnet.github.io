<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this kind of deterioration A softener is simply recording some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (normally salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
<p>In truth, reverse flow testing designed to ensure that backflow preventers avoid backflow was gotten rid of from NFPA 25 in 2011.
