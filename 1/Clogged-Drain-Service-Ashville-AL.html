<p>Repipers start by covering floors and furnishings to safeguard them from water damage and dust during the work. They then find the pipes in your walls with little cuts into the drywall of the walls and ceilings. They will only get rid of as much building material as required to reach, remove, and eliminate the old pipe and replace it with brand-new copper, PEX, or CPVC piping. To gain access to pipes in the floor, plumbers will, whenever possible, enter through the ceiling listed below it. You can set up to have extra pipes put in at this time if you need to broaden your water service for a remodel if you wish.</p>
