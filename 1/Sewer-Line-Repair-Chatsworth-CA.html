<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
