<p>When the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair process. It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to ensure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system ought to be checked to ensure no valves were accidentally exposed or did not close properly when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are totally open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
