<p>Once the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components may have really tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An essential thing to determine on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the motion or directs of the component. The guide is a really critical part of the design of each component. If the component is not fixed properly, the guide could limit the motion (rather than constant or direct) of the part, which might cause the part to not work to its capabilities.
