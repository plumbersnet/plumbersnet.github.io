<p>As soon as the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some elements might have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. A crucial thing to recognize on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the part. The guide is an extremely important part of the design of each part. If the element is not fixed appropriately, the guide might restrict the motion (rather than direct or constant) of the part, which could trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Sometimes springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a way or mechanism to prevent backflow. The basic methods of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow.

The principal types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
