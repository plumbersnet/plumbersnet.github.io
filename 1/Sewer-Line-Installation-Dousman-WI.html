<p>Supplied there isn't a tank failure, generally a commercial hot water heater can be fixed, however is it worth fixing? Just after answering the following questions should you answer repair or replace. Do you understand how many years of ages your water heater is? Do you understand the number of years it's rated for?

<p>If the water feels warm, then the heating aspect is taking longer to heat the water than it should. But this particular concern is when you have no hot water flowing in your house.
