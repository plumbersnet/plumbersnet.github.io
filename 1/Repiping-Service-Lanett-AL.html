<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Lanett AL</h3>
<p>A freshly installed water heater should not produce strange sounds, however it will start to generate rumbling sounds as it ages. The sounds get louder gradually as the heater goes to heat the water. Things intensify considerably for households with a high demand for warm water.

If the water heater still produces rumbling sounds even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement might be required.</p>
