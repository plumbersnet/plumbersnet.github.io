<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one need to initially consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts.

Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with brand-new salt ions.</p>
