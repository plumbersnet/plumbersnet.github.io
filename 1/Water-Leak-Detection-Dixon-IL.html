Changes in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger an effectively working RPZ assembly to occasionally release small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in areas based on water damage. Adequate drainage should also be supplied.</p>
