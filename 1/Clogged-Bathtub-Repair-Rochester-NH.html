The backflow preventer might be required on the water service line, within the building, or in both areas.

Assemblies not currently listed need to have been noted at the time of the original installation.</p>
<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer set will be connected to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally meant for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package just consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The successive 90 ° turns in such a setup can lead to incorrect drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and use the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>
