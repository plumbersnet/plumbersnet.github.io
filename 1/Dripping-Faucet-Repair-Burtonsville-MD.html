<p>In water supply systems, water is generally maintained at a significant pressure to allow water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may stop working or be decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is a suddenly high demand on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe might allow infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>

<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic rust Direct contact between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two different types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a way or system to avoid backflow. The fundamental methods of preventing backflow is an air gap, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The basic mechanism for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The principal types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
