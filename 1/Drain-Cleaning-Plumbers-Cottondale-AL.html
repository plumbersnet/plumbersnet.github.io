<h3>Everything You Need To Know About A Blocked Drain in Cottondale AL 35453</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, because I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months ago. I feel that prices were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March said depending upon the market and seriousness of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
<p>If your old sink flange is undamaged and tight, without any signs of leak, you can most likely leave it in location. Opportunities are good that the mounting brackets on the brand-new system will fit simply fine. To learn, remove the old disposal and install the new flange on it. You can install the new disposal using the old flange if it fits.</p>
<p>Leaky faucets are frustrating, and changing them is an undesirable expense. Conserve money by fixing the faucet yourself. Is your hot water heater leaking or making noises water? Call Polestar Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning at (913) 432-3342 for professional Merriam water heater services. Sometimes water backs up from clogged kitchen sinks. This can happen after the water has currently combined with sewage water in other areas of your home's plumbing network.</p>
<p>The labor costs for disposal installation are mostly time related. If everything is all set, in great condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or 2 of time. If things need to be customized, replaced, or relocated to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the variety of hours required and therefore the overall costs. Many plumbers charge in between $45 and $65 per hour, with the majority of disposal setups running $50 per hour for 3 hours total, making the labor costs approximately $150.</p>
