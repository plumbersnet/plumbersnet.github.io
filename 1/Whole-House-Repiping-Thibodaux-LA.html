I just recently had to replace the water heater in my house and it was just 6 years old. Conventional water heaters with a tank should usually last 10 to 15 years. I also have a dishwasher in my kitchen that has not been used in more than two years. Washing dishes is my least preferred task, particularly without the help of a dishwasher.</p>

<p>The issue of leakage can be credited to any variety of factors which can vary from the tank is old and worn out, to over-pressurization, along with poor maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank ought to have some room to account for the expansion that takes location. The thermal expansion needs to leave, for this reason the need for an expansion tank to help regulate the pressure. If the tank is old and worn, the force put in by the expansion happening when boiling the water triggers the reservoir to split and begin leaking.
