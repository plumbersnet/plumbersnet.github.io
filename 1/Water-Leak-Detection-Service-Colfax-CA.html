<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits build up, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits take place more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe.
