<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc attached to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outside air. This sets off the disc to open, allowing air to restore and enter the valve pressure equivalent to ambient climatic requirement. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>

<h3>Some of the Best Tips for Dealing With Drain Problems in Jamestown NY 14701</h3>
<p>These valves have a lot of flexibility. They're the least pricey of the backflow prevention choices, but they also offer the least amount of protection. An atmospheric vacuum breaker, also known as an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a drifting disc. This disc increases and seals off the air inlet when pressurized and drops to permit air to go into the downstream piping when depressurized.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove particles such as tough water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
