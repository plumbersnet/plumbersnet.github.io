Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day.

This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's probably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
