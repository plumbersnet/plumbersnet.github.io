The cost largely depends on the toilet you select if you need a new toilet. Toilets differ in design, flushing performance and bowl shape, all of that make some toilets more expensive than others. When setting up a brand-new toilet, the plumber may also need to make adjustments to your bathroom's plumbing, which will raise the overall cost of the task.</p>
