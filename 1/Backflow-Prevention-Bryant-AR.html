<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This results in micro-fractures and minimizes the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may stop working without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property.

<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you have to work with a plumber for that burner kit. The total repair expense may remain in the $300 range. A gas water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electrical water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Opt for the new heater.</p>
