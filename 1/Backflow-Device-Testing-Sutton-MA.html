<p>It is important to make sure the equipment is constantly working to the best of its abilities when it comes to your water heater. However, there are many different variables that can present problems and prevent the performance of your system. Need to you experience any problem with your system, from absence of hot water to a leaking tank, contact Johnson Heating & Cooling for an inspection. We will find out what exactly is triggering the problem. You can depend on us for instant service throughout Greenwood and surrounding locations in Central Indiana.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a versatile water supply line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it intends directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the connectors. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can actually cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Check for leakages and tighten them a bit more if required.</p>
