<p>The concern of leakage can be credited to any variety of factors which can vary from the tank is old and worn, to over-pressurization, as well as bad maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank must have some room to account for the growth that takes location. The thermal growth needs to get away, thus the need for an expansion tank to help manage the pressure. If the tank is old and broken, the force applied by the expansion taking place when boiling the water causes the reservoir to split and begin leaking. The solution for this is to replace the water heater system.</p>
