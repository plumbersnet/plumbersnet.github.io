<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Paramount CA</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's drain, cable television or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY task. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
<p>Insecticide from garden hoses: The highly toxic insecticide chlordane was back-siphoned into the water system. An extermination company worker had actually left one end of a garden hose in a barrel of diluted insecticide and the other linked to an external home hose bibb (outside spigot). When the water system system pressure dropped due to repair work, the chlordane was drawn back through your house into the water supply.</p>
