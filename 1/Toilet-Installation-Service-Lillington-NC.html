<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material coated with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is produced. The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>If you do not have a plumber's snake, you can use a wire coat hanger by correcting it. Obviously, it will not reach as far as a plumber's snake would, however it may be long enough to reach some obstructions.
