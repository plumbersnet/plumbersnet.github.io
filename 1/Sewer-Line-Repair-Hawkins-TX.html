For this reason, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this type of deterioration A softener is just catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (typically salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
