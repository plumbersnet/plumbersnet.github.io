<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a natural or artificial, sand-like product covered with favorably charged sodium ions.

The water streams through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
