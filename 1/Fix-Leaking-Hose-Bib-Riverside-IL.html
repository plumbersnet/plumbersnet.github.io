Water temperature issues can be fixed by adjusting the temperature on the water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet might be brought on by a blocked aerator screen. Homeowners can simply unscrew the aerator screen from the faucet to clear out minerals or other deposits. Water pressure can likewise be low if the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the way.</p>
