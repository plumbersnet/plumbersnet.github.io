<p>The issue of leak can be credited to any number of factors which can vary from the tank is old and broken, to over-pressurization, as well as bad maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank should have some room to account for the expansion that takes place. The thermal growth needs to get away, thus the need for an expansion tank to help manage the pressure. The force put in by the expansion taking place when boiling the water triggers the reservoir to break and start leaking if the tank is old and worn out. The solution for this is to replace the hot water heater unit.</p>
