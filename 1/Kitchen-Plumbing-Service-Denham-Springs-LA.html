Undetectable or visible, these problems have actually genuine expenses associated with them. Clogged fixtures cause replacement or refurbishing costs and can annoy your clients. Scale buildup in your water heater will inflate your energy costs, and prematurely harmed RO membranes will leave you with unnecessary replacement expenses.
