<p>Hard water is caused by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners deal with the water by utilizing salt and ion-exchange resins to remove these minerals. When the water comes in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are changed in the option by the salt ions.</p>
<p>The labor costs for disposal installation are primarily time related. If everything is all set, in good condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or more of time. If things need to be modified, replaced, or relocated to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours needed and therefore the total expenses. Most plumbers charge in between $45 and $65 per hour, with the majority of disposal installations running $50 per hour for 3 hours overall, making the labor expenses approximately $150.</p>
