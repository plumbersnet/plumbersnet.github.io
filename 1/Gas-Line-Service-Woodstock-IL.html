<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits build up, until they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits occur more regularly when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, because the toilet does not have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned up if you want to make twice as sure your toilet is the problem before you replace it.
