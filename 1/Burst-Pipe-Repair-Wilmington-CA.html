<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use when backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal option is to have the faulty pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an option to consider if you reside in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for many decades, however steel eventually struggles with corrosion and lacks the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
