<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Belmont NC</h3>
<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not recede against the required instructions of flow. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the community water supply, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being contaminated. If enabled to return to the water system, there is potential for the contaminated water to end up being a health threat. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined routinely for effectiveness, along with inspected yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
