<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then leave into the sewer or septic system from your home. Then that normally means that your main sewer line is backing up when you experience blockages in several drains at once in your home. This can occur in several locations and any combination of drains. For example, water might fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are numerous combinations of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from numerous drain lines in your house.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal service is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is a choice to think about if you live in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for many years, but steel ultimately struggles with corrosion and does not have the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
