<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and guaranteed and meet our rigid trust accreditation standards. A good rule of thumb is to replace faucets that reveal corrosion, rust, cracks, and otherwise deep damages.

Repairs are the right fix for issues such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small components of the whole component. If these replacements and repairs do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we advise a new faucet installation.</p>
