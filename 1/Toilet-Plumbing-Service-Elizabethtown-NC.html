<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. A crucial thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that steadies the movement or directs of the component. The guide is an extremely crucial part of the design of each element. If the component is not fixed correctly, the guide could restrict the movement (rather than direct or consistent) of the element, which could trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the part causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
