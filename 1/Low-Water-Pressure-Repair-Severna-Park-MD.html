<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Severna Park MD</h3>
<p>A garbage disposal is connected with a T to the sink's drain line above the sink track. It plugs into outlet under the sink. Expansion Tank - Some codes need an expansion tank to take in the pressure produced when heated water expands. Do you need sink or faucet repair? Reserve service now. A backflow preventer is a device designed to keep water inside fire-protection and other water-based systems on a residential or commercial property-- ensuring it just travels in one direction: from the water pipe into the system's pipes.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have moderately hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
