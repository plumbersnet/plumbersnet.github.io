<p>Even for a non-steel plumbing system, age will ultimately take its toll. If you observe that your plumbing struggles with various blockages, leakages, and water pressure change that no amount of repairs seems to stem, you must consult a reliable plumber about whole-house repiping as a solution.

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended everyday salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
