<p>Leaks are sneaky. With time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capability to soften tough water.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
