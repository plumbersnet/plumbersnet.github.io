<h3>Some Effective Unclogging Strategies You Can Try in Chester NJ 07930</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months earlier. I feel that rates were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March said depending upon the marketplace and severity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>

You might end up doing more harm than good if you continue to combat with it, which can develop permanent problems.
