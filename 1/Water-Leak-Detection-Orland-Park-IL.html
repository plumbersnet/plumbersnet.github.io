<p>The new inlets and outlets on the tank do not always line up with the old supply lines. Solder in a set of 45-degree fittings to offset each line if needed. Also replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Picture 6). Vent diameters are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You might have to increase or reduce the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CARE: If you're unsure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>

<p>When you eliminate the cap to flush out the valve, examine the washer for wear or cracks. Replacing a bad washer is low-cost and easy. But finding the ideal washer may not be. The most common washers are often offered at home centers and hardware shops. Other designs can be tough to find. Eliminate it and take it to the store to discover a match if you decide to hunt for a washer. Plumbers generally replace the entire fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
<p>If your old sink flange is tight and undamaged, with no indications of leakage, you can most likely leave it in place. Possibilities are great that the installing brackets on the new system will fit just great. To find out, get rid of the old disposal and install the new flange on it. You can install the brand-new disposal utilizing the old flange if it fits.</p>
