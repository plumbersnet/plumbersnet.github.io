<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and after that out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water dishwasher, boiler, and heater, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits.

In severe cases, hard-water deposits can considerably limit the water circulation, which puts excessive pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
