In your house, so much water cleans through the drains, as well as dirt, debris, hair, and other particles. In time, this can all build up. At first, you may not notice that your drains are moving slower, however after time, they will ultimately stop draining completely, which is when, you need the help of a professional.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Inspect spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure distinction throughout the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
