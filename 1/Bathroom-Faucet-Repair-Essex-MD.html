<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Pipeline leak detection is used to determine if and in some cases where a leak has happened in systems which include liquids and gases.

<p>To link a power cord to the new system, get rid of the electrical cover plate on the bottom of the disposer and join the colored wires found inside with their equivalents in the cord, using wire nuts. The green ground wire is looped under the green screw on the unit. This can be done at any point prior to installation. Plumbing strategies are not required for one- and two-family residences or townhouses, as defined in the California Residential Code, and their accessory structures.</p>
