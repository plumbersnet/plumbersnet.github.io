Typically, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like material covered with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>
