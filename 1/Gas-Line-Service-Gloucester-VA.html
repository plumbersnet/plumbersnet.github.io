<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve maintains the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>

<p>Most need for plumbers will come from brand-new building and construction and the need to maintain and repair plumbing systems in existing homes and other buildings. Work of sprinklerfitters is anticipated to increase as states continue to embrace changes to constructing codes that need the use of fire suppression systems. If there was an existing disposal attached to the sink already, it's most likely that the brand-new system will fit the existing bracket. If not-- or if there is no disposal currently in location-- start by removing the old drain. Most drains are attached to the sink by a big nut below the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen up.</p>
