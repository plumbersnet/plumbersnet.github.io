This can cause low flow concerns or perhaps stop a component from streaming altogether.

These water functions are considered a health threat if backflows happen from them. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and location need to be shown on construction plans. Any backflow preventer set up on a fountain or garden pond should be evaluated upon installation and after that each year.</p>
