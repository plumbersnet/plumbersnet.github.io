<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been gotten rid of-- destructive. For this reason, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) ought to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this kind of corrosion A softener is merely capturing some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations while doing so (typically salt or in some cases potassium).</p>

An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a brand-new pipe. This makes building projects quickly the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks use huge pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
