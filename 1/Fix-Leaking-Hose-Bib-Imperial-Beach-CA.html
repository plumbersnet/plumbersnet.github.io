<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have extremely tight tolerances that have to be preserved. An important thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is a very critical part of the style of each component. If the component is not fixed appropriately, the guide might restrict the motion (instead of direct or stable) of the component, which might trigger the component to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the part triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
