<p>If you're dealing with reduced pressure from scale-ridden pipes, dry hair, stiff laundry, and endless device repair costs, you need a water softener. Difficult water is not a problem that will disappear by itself and the expenses incurred by difficult water will just continue to escalate. With a water softener, devices will undoubtedly stop working sooner than their expected life expectancy. Your flow rate will continue to limit and you run the risk of losing water pressure throughout the home if scale continues to collect in your pipes. Difficult water ravages water heaters, and without a softener, your energy expenses will continue to barrel skyward. The continuous cycle of replacements and repairs will continue up until your home is protected by a water softener if your water supply is hard.</p>
