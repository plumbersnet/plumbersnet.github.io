Watering backflow prevention assemblies need to be tested by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to make sure proper backflow prevention remains in location to safeguard our drinking water throughout the watering season. Denver Water will send a testing suggestion notification 1 month before the yearly test is due.</p>

There are a couple of others that I will point out but do not get hung up on them. Because they will be on a certification test, I mention them only.</p>
