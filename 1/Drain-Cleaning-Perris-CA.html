<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound potable supply of water. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the supply of water pressure.

A typical type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

In this method, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which transforms the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their particular carbonates which get sped up.</p>
