<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange websites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The salt water is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to use. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
<p>In order to insure the appropriate operation of a backflow prevention assembly, it needs to be evaluated and certified upon installation and a minimum of once a year afterwards if installed to protect form a health threat situation. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and local water providers oversee these state requirements. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies have internal seals, springs, and moving parts that go through fouling, wear, or fatigue. Likewise, mechanical backflow preventers and air gaps can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow prevention assemblies have to be tested regularly to guarantee that they are operating correctly. Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies need to be tested with properly calibrated gauge equipment.</p>
