<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another consultation, they called him back and he said he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>

The elevation and location of the 100 year flood plain in relation to the center. A minimized pressure zone (RPZ) backflow preventer should typically be set up 1 foot above the 100 year flood plain elevation.</p>
