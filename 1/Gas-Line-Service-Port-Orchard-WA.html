<p>Disposers secure to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most common. To remove the disposer, support it from below and rotate the large, 3-tab mounting ring at the top counterclockwise up until the system falls away.

Constant feed disposals are simple to operate: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this kind of waste disposal unit, however, bottle caps, silverware, and other metal particles can sometimes get captured in the blades. This can harm the blades and need repairs.</p>
