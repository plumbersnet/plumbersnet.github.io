<p>In order to repipe your house, Cabrillo will need to eliminate little sections of your drywall so we can access and replace your pipes. Depending upon the size of your house, this process will likely take a couple of days to a week to complete. Don't stress, while we're working on your house we'll cover all of your furniture, floors and other valuables so that our work does not make a mess. After the entire procedure is ended up and your home is cleaned up, we'll evaluate to make sure that water is flowing correctly through all of your new pipes.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no nearby utilities or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or walkways, dig-free pipe lining might save you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a pail under the P-trap and disconnect the drainpipes. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>
