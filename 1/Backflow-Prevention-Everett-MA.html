<p>This is another combination that can deal with sink obstructions. Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and pour down the drain. Let the mix sit for numerous hours, then flush with boiling water. You can repeat this procedure if it doesn't work the first time.

When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is important that just initial factory repair parts are used.
