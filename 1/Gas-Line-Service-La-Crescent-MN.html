We see this a lot on traditional electrical hot water heater, which use a set of electric heating aspects to heat the tank. Often, among the two stress out, leading to water that's not hot however warm. If this isn't it, we can replace it or detect the real problem.</p>
<p>Check to make sure it's not your garbage disposal that's triggering the problem. A clogged disposal can block the drain, so run the disposal to see if that clears the clog. Then inspect it to ensure it's running properly. You may need to flip the switch found on the side or bottom of the unit beneath the sink if the disposal has overheated.</p>
