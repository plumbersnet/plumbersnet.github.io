<h3>Clogged Drain in Ankeny Iowa</h2>

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no further repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not come back because he had another visit. A best bad plumber story.</p>
