<p>A continuous-feed garbage disposal is the most common type which continues to run as long as the power switch is on. A continuous-feed disposal is best for combating big quantities of food waste. Many garbage disposals are plug-in, as it is more secure to have a vibrating unit come unplugged then detached from fixed wiring.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another appointment, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A best bad plumber story.</p>
