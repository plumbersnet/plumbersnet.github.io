<p>The concern of leakage can be attributed to any number of elements which can range from the tank is old and broken, to over-pressurization, as well as poor maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank must have some room to account for the expansion that takes location. The thermal expansion needs to get away, hence the need for a growth tank to help regulate the pressure. If the tank is old and worn out, the force put in by the growth occurring when boiling the water triggers the tank to crack and start leaking. The solution for this is to replace the water heater unit.</p>
