<p>Polybutylene used inside your home can be found near the water heater or coming out of the walls to feed sinks or toilets. Caution: some plumbers installed stub outs" of copper when leaving the wall. Because copper is showing does not suggest you do not have polybutylene pipes, just. You may need to make a little hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
