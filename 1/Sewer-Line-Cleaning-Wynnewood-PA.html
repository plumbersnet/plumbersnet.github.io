If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>

<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet in Wynnewood PA 19096</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
