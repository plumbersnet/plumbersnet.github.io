<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that enables water to go through it in one instructions, but avoids it from reversing in the opposite instructions. You might be familiar with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, basically, the same thing, but without the zinc coating. The zinc covering on galvanized pipe for gas is meant to keep the pipe from rusting from contact with wetness. While it does its job pretty well, in time, it still does rust. This enables the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>
