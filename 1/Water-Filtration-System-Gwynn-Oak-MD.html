<p>Hidden water leaks are typically stressful and have Potentially Severe Repercussions. When it rains, any excess water is expected to go down a storm drain in order to prevent flooding problems. If you are presently experiencing any flooding on your property when it rains, then there is a great chance that the storm drain is clogged and for that reason needs to be cleaned out. If a clogged storm drain is not dealt with in a timely manner, the opportunities are high that it will trigger additional damage to the storm pipe, which will require repair.</p>
<p>You rely on your drains to carry wastewater from your shower, tub or sink. Over time, the drains become clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more.

If you do have regular leaks, we discover that repiping can in fact be the less expensive and better long-lasting solution.</p>
