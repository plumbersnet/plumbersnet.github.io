<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits accumulate, until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits happen more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, due to the fact that the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. If you wish to make two times as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it, you might have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
