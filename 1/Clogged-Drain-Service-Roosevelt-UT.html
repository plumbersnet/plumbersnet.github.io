<h3>Why A Water Leak Detection System Is Important For Your Home in Roosevelt UT 84066</h3>
<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Rather than dislodging the clog with negative pressure, it actually pushes into the blockage, working further into where the obstruction is occurring. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to stream easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped idea helps require it further down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
