<h3>Water Heater Repair Services in Waconia MN 55387</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Deal" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months earlier. I feel that rates were increased due to the fact that I had a "Offer". An Angie's list article from March said depending on the marketplace and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my past invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
<p>If your old sink flange is intact and tight, without any signs of leak, you can probably leave it in location. Opportunities are good that the installing brackets on the new unit will fit simply great. To find out, remove the old disposal and install the brand-new flange on it. If it fits, you can install the brand-new disposal using the old flange.</p>
<p>Tough water is triggered by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to get rid of these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active sites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the solution by the salt ions.</p>
