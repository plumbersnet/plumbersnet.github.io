<p>Backflow is the unwanted turnaround of flow in a potable water distribution system. Water that is always under pressure can only stream in one instructions. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will always stream toward the point of lowest pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened numerous fire hydrants to help battle a fire, the pressure in the water pipe might drop. The need upstream could cause a turnaround in circulation.</p>

<p>Your disposer might feature a thin rubber gasket to be used under the sink flange, rather of the standard plumber's putty as described below. Both will produce a great seal (though the gasket might lead to percentages of water gathering around the flange), and what's utilized is mostly a matter of choice. Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's harder to eliminate.</p>
<p>Add more hot water if it gradually recedes as you work. Keep plunging until the drain is clear or you choose it's time to try a brand-new approach.
