<p>Inspect the washer for wear or cracks when you get rid of the cap to flush out the valve. Replacing a bad washer is low-cost and simple. However discovering the right washer might not be. The most common washers are typically offered in the house centers and hardware shops. Other designs can be hard to discover. Eliminate it and take it to the shop to find a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers generally replace the entire fill valve instead of hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
