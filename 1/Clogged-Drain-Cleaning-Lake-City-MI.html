<p>Once the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components might have very tight tolerances that need to be kept. A crucial thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each element. If the part is not fixed correctly, the guide could limit the motion (rather than stable or direct) of the component, which might trigger the component to not work to its capabilities. Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are restricting the travel of the element triggering lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
