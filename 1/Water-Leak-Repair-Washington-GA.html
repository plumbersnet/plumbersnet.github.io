<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's DIY job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
