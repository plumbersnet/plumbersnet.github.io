<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater in Bristow OK 74010</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
