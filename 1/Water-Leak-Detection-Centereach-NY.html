<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection demands. No hot water in your home? Is your water taking too long to warm up? Is your water heater making noises, or do you see rusty colored water in your home? If you have any of these concerns, your water heater might need maintenance, repairs or even a replacement. While some of these issues can be attributed to normal wear and tear or inappropriate installation, in some cases your garbage disposal ends up being harmed by items that should not be gone through it.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not uncommon, however if your toilet is blocking more than three times a month, there's a bigger problem to take a look at. If your toilet is fairly new, you may need to switch bathroom tissue or hire a plumber to clear a clog from the drain. The National Contractor License Service keeps a list of each state's professional licensing agency where you can look up your state's licensing details. Check the list of state licensing companies to learn whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also preserves a licensing tool to check state licensing requirements.</p>

Remove the cover plate below the disposal and attach the wires according the maker's instructions if yours doesn't. Many basic disposals have you attach white wires to white wires and black wires to black wires. When you're ended up, screw the cover plate back on.</p>
