<p>When you get rid of the cap to flush out the valve, inspect the washer for wear or fractures. Changing a bad washer is inexpensive and simple. But finding the ideal washer may not be. The most typical washers are often offered in your home centers and hardware shops. Other styles can be hard to find. Eliminate it and take it to the shop to find a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers typically replace the entire fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
