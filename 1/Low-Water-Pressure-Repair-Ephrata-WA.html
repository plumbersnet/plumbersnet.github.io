<h3>Water Heater Repair Procedures in Ephrata WA 98823</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener parts. When these elements are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in tough water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are fully exchanged, the water softener goes through a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
