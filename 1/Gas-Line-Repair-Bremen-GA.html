<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the real ion exchange, or water softening, happens. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the sodium, or salt, is kept and blended with water. If you plan to drain  your automated dishwasher through your disposer, find the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). If you will not utilize your system to drain a dishwasher, leave the breakout plate undamaged.</p>
<p>DCVs are specifically developed to avoid backflow in fire sprinkler systems. The pillar for typical fire defense applications, DCVs feature an inlet (upstream) shutoff valve, two individually operating spring-loaded check valves (typically inside a single valve body), four test dicks, and an outlet (downstream) shutoff valve. Light-duty commercial-grade waste disposal unit start around $500-$ 2,500 and increase depending upon size, brand and functions.</p>
