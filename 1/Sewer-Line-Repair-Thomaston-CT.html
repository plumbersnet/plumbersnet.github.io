<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
