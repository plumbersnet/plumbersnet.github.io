<h3>Clogged Drains Driving You Crazy Never Call The Emergency Plumber Again Cromwell CT</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered problem. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
