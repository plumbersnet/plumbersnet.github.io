If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Not all toilet problems need the assistance of a professional. Some small blockages can be looked after with a plunger and often, when the toilet will not stop running, it's a basic matter of replacing the chain on the flapper valve inside the tank. Nevertheless, particular issues do call for a qualified plumber, and it's important to understand the difference to prevent lost disappointment, cash, and time.</p>
