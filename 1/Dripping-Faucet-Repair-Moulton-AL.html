<p>It's Making sounds - As your water heats up, there are minerals that are falling and separating to your tank's bottom. This will trigger it to work more difficult and can create noise. If your energy expenses are rising, a brand-new, higher performance water heater can bring them back down. All that has to be done is closing off the inlet and outlet valves of the softener and open up the bypass valve, allowing hard water to stream to the tank and household taps. After that the softener can be disconnected, transferred to its new area and put there.</p>
