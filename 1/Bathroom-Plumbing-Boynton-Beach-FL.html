<h3>Some of the Best Tips for Dealing With Drain Problems in Boynton Beach FL 33436</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
