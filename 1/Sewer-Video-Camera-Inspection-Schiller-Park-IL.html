Repairs are the correct fix for issues such as missing out on or harmed washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small parts of the entire fixture. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of changing your faucet, then we suggest a new faucet installation.</p>
