When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being infected. If allowed to re-enter the water system, there is capacity for the polluted water to become a health danger. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for effectiveness, as well as checked yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an extremely pure type of water. When water evaporates it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>

The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and benefit back siphonage only for non-health risk or health threat conditions. They must be set up downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on a watering system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It must also be installed at least 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local authorities, need that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet). Some towns do not allow the use of GFAVB's. These units will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can just protect against back siphonage.</p>
