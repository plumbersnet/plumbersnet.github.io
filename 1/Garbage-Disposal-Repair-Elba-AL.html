<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are lots of other little toilet parts that ought to also be well maintained to help prevent leaks and other toilet troubles. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to harden and split or just be so crushed that it doesn't fill the space in addition to it used to, and you end up with water all over the place. Just like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl washers and bolts can become rusty or so used that they spring a leak.
