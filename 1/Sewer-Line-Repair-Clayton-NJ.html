<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. With time, the deposits accumulate, up until they form a traffic jam that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes. These deposits take place more frequently when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals far from the drain pipe. You could have your drain pipes expertly cleaned if you desire to make doubly sure your toilet is the problem prior to you replace it. It's time for a brand-new one if your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still blocks.</p>
