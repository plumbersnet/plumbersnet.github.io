<p>You can also depend upon water softeners to minimize your day-to-day operating costs by saving detergent and enabling you to utilize lower water temperatures while preserving a premium wash. Water hardness, determined by the grains per gallon (gpg) of magnesium and calcium in the water, differs across the U.S. from slightly difficult (<3 gpg) to very hard (>14 gpg).</p>
<p>Sooner or later, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer system calculates the amount of water that flows through the softener. Regeneration automatically starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom home and family of four, regeneration normally happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>In some cases you need to replace a sink-- when an enamel sink is significantly damaged, or when any sink is leaking. And sometimes you're just ready for a kitchen update. If you want one or more sinks in your house to  have soft water for much easier dish washing, under-sink and counter top softeners can help. These localized softeners are easy to install and normally affordable, though you'll need to budget for replacement filters.</p>
