<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
