<p>Most homes or structures that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather protection. As the outer coating of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
