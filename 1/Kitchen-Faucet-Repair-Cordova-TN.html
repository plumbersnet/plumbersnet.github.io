<p>Clearly the resin is not an endless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange sites are changed with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use as soon as backwashing is total. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
<p>A well-designed irrigation system is necessary for the health of plants in a landscape but it's likewise crucial for human health. An effective irrigation system keeps the water for landscapes different from drinkable drinking water, preventing contamination that can trigger health problems. That's why a backflow preventer is a requirement on any watering project.</p>
