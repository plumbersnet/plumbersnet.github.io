<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must initially consider problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these aspects are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions found in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and charge with new salt ions.</p>
