For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this kind of rust A softener is just catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (generally sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
