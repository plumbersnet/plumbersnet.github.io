<p>In water system systems, water is typically kept at a substantial pressure to make it possible for water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure might be or stop working reduced when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an unexpectedly high demand on the water system (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe might allow contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
