An atmospheric vacuum breaker, likewise called an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a drifting disc. When pressurized and drops to permit air to get in the downstream piping when depressurized, this disc seals and rises off the air inlet.</p>
<p>Dry pipe systems usually are set up in large, unheated locations, such as parking lot. These systems have pressurized air or nitrogen in the pipe, which keeps the main dry-pipe valve closed. When a sprinkler triggers due to heat, the air is released, enabling the dry-pipe valve to open, filling the system with water, which is discharged through the open sprinkler head to reduce the fire.</p>
