<h3>Helpful Tips For Selecting A Reputable, Budget Friendly Plumber Powhatan VA</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup.

If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
