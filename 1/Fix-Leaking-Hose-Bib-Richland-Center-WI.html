<p>A water softener has 2 tanks: a mineral tank and a brine tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, occurs. It's filled with little, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The brine tank is where the salt, or salt, is saved and blended with water. If you plan to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1).

Then they are changed in the service by the sodium ions.</p>
