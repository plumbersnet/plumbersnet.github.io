<h3>Clogged Pipes in Nicholasville Kentucky</h2>
<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are installed in locations where water might trigger devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and areas with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the basic structural stability of the system.

Inappropriate installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to spot.</p>
