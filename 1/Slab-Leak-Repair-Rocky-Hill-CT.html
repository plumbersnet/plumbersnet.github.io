<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs.

<h3>Unclog Drains, Toilets and Sewers With The Help of Rocky Hill CT 06067 Plumbers</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Offer" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, given that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the specific sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months ago. I feel that costs were increased because I had a "Offer". An Angie's list post from March stated depending on the marketplace and intensity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting price gouged.</p>
<p>If your old sink flange is tight and undamaged, without any signs of leak, you can most likely leave it in place. Possibilities are good that the mounting brackets on the brand-new system will fit simply fine. To discover, eliminate the old disposal and install the new flange on it. If it fits, you can install the new disposal using the old flange.</p>
