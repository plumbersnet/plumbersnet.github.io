<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material covered with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water streams through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>

And whether residential or industrial, broken pipes can trigger leakage into the supply of water, which can be a significant reason for issue and even an environmental hazard if a sewage line is included.
