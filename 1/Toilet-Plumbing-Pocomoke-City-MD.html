When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated properly.

A cracked rotor valve or rotor valve seal may also be the perpetrator. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regeneration procedures. A worn water valve can lock up and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is likely split and just needs to be changed.</p>
