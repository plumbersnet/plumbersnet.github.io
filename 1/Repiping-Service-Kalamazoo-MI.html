<p>Your home's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not truly the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you put down there won't go through.</p>
<p>Changed 50 gallon electrical water heater, thermal expansion tank, and pressure regulator valve. When most people think about plumbers, they typically call them for water pipe problems. The natural gas plumber will have a license that states she or he is licensed to deal with and install natural gas lines. Homeowners should consider whether the plumber has a master plumbing license, which represents a high degree of experience, qualifications and knowledge.</p>

You might need to make a small hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
