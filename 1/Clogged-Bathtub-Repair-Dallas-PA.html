<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
<p>When the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
