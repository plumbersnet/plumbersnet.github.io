<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another appointment, they called him back and he stated he would not come back.
