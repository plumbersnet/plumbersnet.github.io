This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove debris such as tough water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>

Mechanical backflow prevention assemblies need to be checked with appropriately calibrated gauge equipment.</p>
