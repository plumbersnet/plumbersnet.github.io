<p>Discovering high water pressure at plumbing components in your house? Water pressure in the house is similar to high blood pressure in the body - it needs to be controlled to keep the system healthy. When unregulated water pressure triggers damage to the plumbing system, this can lead to emergency plumbing calls, like flooding. Having a water pressure regulator set up is MUCH more cost-efficient than mold removal or replacing floor covering or drywall! So we recommend fixing or installing water pressure regulators to protect your whole house.</p>
