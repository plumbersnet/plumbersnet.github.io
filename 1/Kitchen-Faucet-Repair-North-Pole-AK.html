<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
