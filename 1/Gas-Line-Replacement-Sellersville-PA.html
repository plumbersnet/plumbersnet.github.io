If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet.

Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water system pressure.
