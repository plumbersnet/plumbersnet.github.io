<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in Copperas Cove TX 76522</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
<p>Responsive circulation innovation works by continuously bringing tanks off-line and on-line in action to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, just one of the 4 tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill. This responsive style enables the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than standard single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
