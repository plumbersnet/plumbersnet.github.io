<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Services Mandan ND</h3>
<p>The majority of homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to rust. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather condition protection. As the external coating of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
