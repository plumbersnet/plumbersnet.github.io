<h3>Why A Water Leak Detection System Is Important For Your Home in Hudson NC 28638</h3>
<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one ought to first think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these aspects are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
