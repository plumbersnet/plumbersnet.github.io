<h3>The Importance Of Plumbers And Plumbing Services Brooklyn MD</h3>
<p>Making use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact in between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two various kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is developed because of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
