Bear in mind that because of the way a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so be sure you're turning things the correct method. When you've protected the trip lever and are prepared to connect your flapper, make certain you've got simply enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you push down on the trip lever.</p>
