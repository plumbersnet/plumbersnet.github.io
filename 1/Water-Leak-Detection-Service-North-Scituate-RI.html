<p>A newly set up hot water heater need to not produce strange sounds, however it will start to generate rumbling noises as it ages. The noises get louder with time as the heater goes to heat up the water. Things get worse significantly for households with a high demand for hot water. The reasons for the sounds can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which must be flushed to restore normalcy. If the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has been flushed, a water heater replacement may be needed.</p>
<p>Pull the 2 lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the harmed fuel lines. When you pull the fuel lines from the trimmer, a little round fuel line filter will pop off the thin line leading into the tank.
