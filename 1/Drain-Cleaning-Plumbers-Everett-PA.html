For instance, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from vehicle cleans; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler might enter the drinking waterline; germs and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from cooling cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray development might flow backwards into the potable water supply. To safeguard water quality, backflow protection is required where completion user positions a danger of contaminating the city's water supply.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a method or system to prevent backflow. The standard methods of preventing backflow is an air gap, which either removes a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow. The basic system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow.
