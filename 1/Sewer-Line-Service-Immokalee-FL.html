<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some components might have really tight tolerances that need to be preserved. An essential thing to recognize on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is an extremely vital part of the design of each part. If the element is not fixed effectively, the guide might limit the motion (instead of steady or direct) of the part, which might cause the part to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the part triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
