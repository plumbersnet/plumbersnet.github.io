<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is reduced by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone rises toward the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>

<p>Firstly, never ever plant anything up against your home, in front of windows, nor near your lateral. (Your lateral is the significant line from your house to the city line.) If you have had plumbing service prior to planting, you might have an idea of where your lateral is located. If you do not know, invest the minimal cost to have a professional plumber find the lateral for you so that you do not make the mistake of planting over, to close, and even dig into and break the line. If you are employing someone to plant for you, ensure to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that she or he will also know the areas to avoid. If you have a clean-out, your line will be simple to recognize.</p>
