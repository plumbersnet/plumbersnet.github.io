<p>Most plumbers will get rid of the old system to install the new one at the exact same per hour rate. This can increase the amount of time required to install the brand-new system, therefore increasing costs. This really depends upon what condition the rest of the pipes are in, and how difficult the old system is to remove. In a lot of cases, elimination will only add an additional $25 to $50 to the overall costs, however in some cases the costs could be higher if additional pipes need to also be changed.</p>

The mix will bubble and fizz for a bit as it cleans up the disposal.</p>
