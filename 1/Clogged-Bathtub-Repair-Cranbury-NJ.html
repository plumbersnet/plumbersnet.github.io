<p>The issue of leak can be credited to any variety of elements which can vary from the tank is old and worn, to over-pressurization, as well as bad maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank should have some room to account for the growth that takes place. The thermal growth needs to leave, hence the need for an expansion tank to help manage the pressure. If the tank is old and broken, the force applied by the growth occurring when boiling the water causes the reservoir to break and begin leaking. The solution for this is to replace the hot water heater system.</p>
