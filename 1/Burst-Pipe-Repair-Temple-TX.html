<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that allows water to go through it in one direction, but avoids it from going backwards in the opposite direction. You may be acquainted with galvanized pipe for gas". Black iron pipe is, basically, the very same thing, but without the zinc finish. The zinc coating on galvanized pipe for gas is suggested to keep the pipe from rusting from contact with wetness. While it does its job quite well, in time, it still does rust. This permits the toilet to flush. A plumber will charge $135 to fix it.</p>
<p>Prior to selection and installation, refer to producers literature for temperature level ranges. All assemblies must be protected from freezing temperature levels and if installed where temperature levels will reach 100 degrees F or above, a warm water type assembly must be used. Speak with manufacturers specs for suggestions.
