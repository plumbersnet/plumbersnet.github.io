If your home is over 50 years old, it's an excellent bet it's time to replace the plumbing, at a minimum cost of $2,000 and a maximum of $15,000. The large variation in cost is due to the size of your home, the kind of pipe you're installing, and additional repairs you find you need to make at any time you go behind walls.</p>
<p>The typical time to install or replace a garbage disposal ranges from 2 to 3 hours. A handyman charges $25 and $45 per hour while plumbers charge $45 and $100 per hour.
