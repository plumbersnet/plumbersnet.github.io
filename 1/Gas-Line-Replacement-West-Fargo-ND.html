<h3>Best Plumbing Service Company In West Fargo ND</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY job. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Likewise called cabling, we snake a coiled metal wire down the pipe while we rotate on our end to unclog drains. This method works best for clearing out drains clogged with hair and particles, such as showers and sinks.
