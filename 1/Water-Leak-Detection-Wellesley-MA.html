<p>When you have a clogged piping system in your Miami, Florida premises, you can either choose a plumber who digs up your yard, excavates the walls and tears up the structure during the pipe repairs, or you can have the insight to hire a professional such as Eco 1 Plumbing. If you need pipes changed, you will need to work with a professional plumber. The cost of having pipes repaired or changed can differ significantly depending upon the place of the pipes, the actual problem, and the concern of fixing or replacing; however typically, the cost to replace pipes is $80-$ 440 per hour or a fixed cost of about $222.
