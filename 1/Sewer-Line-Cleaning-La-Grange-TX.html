<h3>Fix A Leaking Water Pipe in La Grange TX 78945</h3>
<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- destructive. For this reason, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of corrosion A softener is simply capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (usually salt or often potassium).</p>
<p>Every day, the drains in your house effectively remove large amounts of water and waste.
