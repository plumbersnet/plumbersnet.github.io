<p>Sometimes you need to replace a sink-- when an enamel sink is severely damaged, or when any sink is leaking. And in some cases you're simply all set for a kitchen upgrade. If you want one or more sinks in your house to  have soft water for simpler meal washing, under-sink and countertop softeners can help. These localized softeners are easy to install and normally affordable, though you'll have to budget for replacement filters.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no neighboring energies or blockages, digging through and changing the pipe manually would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. However, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or sidewalks, dig-free pipe lining might save you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a container under the P-trap and disconnect the drains. Then remove the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>
