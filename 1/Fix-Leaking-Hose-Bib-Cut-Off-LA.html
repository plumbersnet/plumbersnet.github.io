<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Our plumbers are licensed, bonded, and insured and meet our stiff trust certification standards. An excellent guideline is to replace faucets that show corrosion, rust, fractures, and otherwise deep damages. Run-down and wore away parts make repairs hard and costly, indicating a faucet installation is more worthwhile. Repairs are the right fix for issues such as missing or harmed washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other little components of the whole fixture. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we recommend a new faucet installation.</p>
