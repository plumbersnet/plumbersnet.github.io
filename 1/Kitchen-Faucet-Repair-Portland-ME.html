<p>Demand loads, no matter what their usage, need to be met by a sufficiently sized supply of water, which constitutes the 2nd significant element of a water system system. With sufficient tank capacity to satisfy variable peak load need, the water system source can offer a constant circulation of water. Throughout hours of low need, the water flow can be utilized to fill up storage towers, cisterns and tanks, which then supply water for emergency usage and durations when demand exceeds the baseline pumping rate. A supply of water source can take many types, including groundwater extraction well fields, free-flowing rivers, manufactured or natural ponds, artesian springs, ocean water desalination plants, and rainwater run-off collection systems.</p>
<p>The problem of leakage can be attributed to any number of elements which can vary from the tank is old and worn out, to over-pressurization, as well as bad maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank need to have some room to account for the expansion that takes location. The thermal growth needs to leave, thus the need for a growth tank to assist control the pressure. The force applied by the growth taking place when boiling the water triggers the tank to crack and begin leaking if the tank is old and worn out. The treatment for this is to replace the water heater unit.</p>
