Continuous feed disposals are simple to operate: you run water in the kitchen sink, flip a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this kind of waste disposal unit, however, bottle caps, flatware, and other metal debris can in some cases get captured in the blades. This can damage the blades and require repairs.</p>
