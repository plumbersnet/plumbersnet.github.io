<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and associated devices includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others.

<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
