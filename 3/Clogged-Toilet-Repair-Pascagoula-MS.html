<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when looking for a viable option, especially when basic plunging doesn't appear to work. Nevertheless, there are many disadvantages to utilizing these harmful items - not least of which is that they normally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life.
