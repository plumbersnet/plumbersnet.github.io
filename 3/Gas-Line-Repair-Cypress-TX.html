New assemblies must be tested by a State of Washington certified backflow assembly tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report should be offered to us.

<p>Once you've discovered the journey lever you desire, all you really need to do is (CAREFULLY!) eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Keep in mind that due to the fact that of the way a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the proper method. When you've protected the journey lever and are ready to attach your flapper, make sure you've got just enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the method when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
