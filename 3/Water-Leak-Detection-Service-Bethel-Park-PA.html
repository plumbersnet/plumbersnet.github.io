<p>Lastly, the most complex and advanced backflow preventer is the decreased pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five independently operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other four. During standard water streams at design pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if pricey) device is best used in vital locations where cross contamination might be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
<p>Add more hot water if it slowly drains away as you work. Keep plunging up until the drain is clear or you choose it's time to attempt a new approach. Tankless systems link directly to your plumbing and only heat the water as it is needed. This results in savings on your energy bill.

Then install the leading half of the drain from the top, and screw the nut and installing bracket on from below. Make sure to eliminate any excess plumber's putty using a putty knife.
