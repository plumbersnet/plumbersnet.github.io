<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when searching for a practical option, specifically when basic plunging does not seem to work. However, there are lots of disadvantages to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they usually contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the danger of damage to your home and family.</p>
