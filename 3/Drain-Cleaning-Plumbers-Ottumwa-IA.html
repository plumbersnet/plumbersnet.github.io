If it fits, you can install the brand-new disposal utilizing the old flange.</p>
<p>Passive Purge - Up to 2007, some houses were permitted to forego a physical backflow device in lieu of a system where stagnant water was purged from the system with usage of several toilets in the home. Normally, the water supply to one of the upper floor toilets was piped from the fire lawn sprinkler; upon each usage, fresh water was introduced into the fire lawn sprinkler.</p>

Continued attempts by yourself can damage your lines, and you may have a more major underlying issue than you understand. Furthermore, the longer you delay to call for professional assistance, the higher the possibility that you will have sewage back up in your pipes.</p>
