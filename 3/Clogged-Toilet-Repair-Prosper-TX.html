Recurring leaks and repairs. If your hot water heater is over ten years old, it has actually likely lost much of its performance; continuing to repair it, with its frequent breakdowns, is not economical in the long run. As a result, we advise replacing your unit if it is over 10 years old.</p>

Installation includes over a lots steps, and eliminating the old one involves much more operations. It can be tough comparing cut outs and fixture holes, and getting the new installation flat and level with whatever sealed up.</p>
