<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips at Carl Junction MO 64834</h3>
<p>If your old disposal is broken beyond repair, you'll have to replace it. Although any broken home appliance is irritating to deal with, the bright side is that setting up a replacement disposal will be less expensive than setting up a brand-new garbage disposal in a sink that has never had one before. Depending on the pro you work with, it can be as much as half the cost.</p>
<p>From underneath the sink, put a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Secure the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring. Next, make certain the drain compression seal is seated effectively in the drain locknut, then re-install and tighten up the drain locknut. Lastly, switch on the water and test for leakages.</p>
