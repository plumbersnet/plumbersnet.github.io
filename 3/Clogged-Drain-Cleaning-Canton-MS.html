<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
