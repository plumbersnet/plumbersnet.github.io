<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water streams through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
