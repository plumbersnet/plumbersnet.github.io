<p>Last but not least, the most sophisticated and complicated backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 individually operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other 4. During standard water flows at style pressure, the two check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if costly) device is best utilized in critical areas where cross contamination might be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
