<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned and examined and the rubber parts have actually been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some components may have really tight tolerances that have to be preserved. A crucial thing to recognize on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the part. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each element. If the component is not fixed correctly, the guide could limit the movement (rather than direct or constant) of the component, which might cause the element to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
