<p>Check to make certain it's not your waste disposal unit that's triggering the problem. A clogged disposal can block the drain, so run the disposal to see if that clears the clog.

<p>Your disposer might include a thin rubber gasket to be utilized under the sink flange, instead of the traditional plumber's putty as laid out listed below. Both will create a great seal (though the gasket may lead to percentages of water collecting around the flange), and what's used is mostly a matter of preference. Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's harder to remove.</p>
