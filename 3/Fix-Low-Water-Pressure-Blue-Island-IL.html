<p>Have used Plumb Crazy on three various occasions, the last involving a water line repair for a leak under the cement slab in our home. Billy and Hector were our specialists and they were wonderful. They rapidly discovered the leak and repaired it without making a big mess.

<p>To get rid of the smells, first try pouring BioSmart (readily available at WJ McNabb Plumbing) down your drain. You can also attempt 1 cup lemon juice down the drain. After a couple of minutes, run warm thin down the drain. Inaccessible or inadequate cleanouts: No matter how reliable a drainage system is, it will likely get clogged at some point. Plumbers and house owners need to be able to clean out their drainage pipes when this takes place. Buildings without enough cleanout valves, or cleanout valves that can't be quickly reached, are at risk of a pipe rupturing.</p>
