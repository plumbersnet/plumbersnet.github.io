<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Hohenwald TN 38462?</h3>
<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- destructive. For this factor, WQA advises that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this kind of corrosion A softener is simply capturing some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (usually sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
<p>Every day, the drains in your home effectively remove large amounts of water and waste. Gradually, dirt, debris, hair, and many other small particles can get trapped and develop in your pipes.

When this happens, it might be time to call on a professional from Atlas Plumbing to examine.</p>
