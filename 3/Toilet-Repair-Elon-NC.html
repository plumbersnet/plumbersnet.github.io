Water pressure may stop working or be lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an unexpectedly high demand on the water system (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened).

<h3>How To Find The Best Plumbing Services Elon NC</h3>
<p>The use of different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic rust Direct contact between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two various kinds of metal are conductively linked to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed due to the fact that of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to prevent overfilling.
