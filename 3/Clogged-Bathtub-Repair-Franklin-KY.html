WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
