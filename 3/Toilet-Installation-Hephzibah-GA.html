<p>Metal alloys are prone to an electro-chemical condition called rust. Deterioration can actually consume a metal away causing the metal to not be as strong as it originally was or alter the tolerances causing parts to not work in a backflow preventer. If the part is functional or must be changed, the impact of corrosion on a metal alloy must be examined to figure out.</p>

They then locate the pipes in your walls with small cuts into the drywall of the walls and ceilings. They will just get rid of as much structure material as needed to reach, remove, and eliminate the old pipe and replace it with new copper, PEX, or CPVC piping.
