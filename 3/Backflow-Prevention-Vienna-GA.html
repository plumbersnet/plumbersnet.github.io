<p>Pictures provided by the American Backflow Prevention Association. The cost to repipe a house with copper pipe is between $8,000 and $16,000 or about $3 to $8 per direct foot. Replacing galvanized drain, waste, and vent pipe with copper costs $13 to $15 per direct foot. Copper pipe is more expensive than PEX, but it has some exceptional advantages.
