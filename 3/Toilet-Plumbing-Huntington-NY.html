<p>It is very important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt an appropriately working RPZ assembly to occasionally release small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in locations based on water damage. Appropriate drainage must also be supplied.</p>
