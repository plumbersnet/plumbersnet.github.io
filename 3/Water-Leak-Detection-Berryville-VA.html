<h3>The Many Services Provided By Residential Plumbers Berryville VA</h3>
<p>A. Normally wax does not "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible water system line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a good seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Connections that are too tight can actually cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. Look for leakages and tighten them a bit more if needed.</p>
