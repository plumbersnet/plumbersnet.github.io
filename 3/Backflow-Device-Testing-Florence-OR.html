<p>Backflow is water flowing in the opposite instructions from its typical flow. IRWD's drinkable water system is created to keep the water streaming to you. When hydraulic conditions within any water supply deviate from "regular," the instructions of water flow can be reversed. This creates a backflow condition and the capacity for infected water entering the potable water distribution system.</p>
<p>Wire the disposal. Some disposals come with home appliance wires connected, and others do not. If yours does not, eliminate the cover plate underneath the disposal and attach the wires according the manufacturer's guidelines. Most standard disposals have you connect white wires to black wires and white wires to black wires. When you're completed, screw the cover plate back on.</p>
