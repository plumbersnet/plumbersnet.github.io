<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your home, which makes its plumbing's effective functioning a requirement more than a need.

Leaking faucets such as shower valves, tub faucets and sink faucets do not get replaced when repiped.</p>
<p>Next, acknowledge that unless your water is incredibly tough, all the inbound water does not need to be softened. Showers, sinks, and laundry connections most likely need to be softened; toilets, outside spigots, and basement sinks can be bypassed. In some cases, you may prefer to soften the hot water only.
