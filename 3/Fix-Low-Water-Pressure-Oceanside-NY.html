<p>Changing your flapper may need somewhat different steps than we show (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task if you have an unusual flush valve. To discover an appropriate replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water before removing the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, but opportunities are you'll find one of the very same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
