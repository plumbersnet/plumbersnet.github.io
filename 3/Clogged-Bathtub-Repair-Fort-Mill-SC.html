<p>Unfortunately, when water is totally stripped of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it often becomes corrosive. Destructive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, particularly in locations where water sits for extended periods of time. Although this is not a health issue, it is the main reason for the blue and green stains being left in your bathroom and utility room sinks.</p>
<p>The majority of need for plumbers will originate from new construction and the need to repair and preserve plumbing systems in existing residences and other buildings. Work of sprinklerfitters is expected to increase as states continue to embrace modifications to building codes that need making use of fire suppression systems. If there was an existing disposal connected to the sink already, it's most likely that the brand-new system will fit the existing bracket. If not-- or if there is no disposal currently in place-- start by getting rid of the old drain. A lot of drains are connected to the sink by a large nut beneath the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen.</p>
