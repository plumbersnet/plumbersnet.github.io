<h3>Do's And Don'ts Of Emergency Plumbing Troubles Norton MA</h3>

If you are experiencing a leak coming from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>If the hot water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is an indicator the tank is failing and will need to be changed.
