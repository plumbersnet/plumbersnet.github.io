<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back because he had another consultation. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>

<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Magnolia MS</h3>
<p>Many houses or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather security. As the external covering of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when looking for a viable solution, specifically when easy plunging does not seem to work. However, there are numerous disadvantages to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they generally contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, however at the cost of providing the risk of damage to your house and family.</p>
