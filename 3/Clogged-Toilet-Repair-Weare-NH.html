<p>In the very first half of the twentieth century, a range of products were utilized for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are durable in the short-term, they deteriorate over years. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are prone to several types of corrosion. After about fifty years, they'll start to damage from corrosion and may place toxic substances into the freshwater supply. We recommend replacing the clay, steel, and iron pipes in your house.
