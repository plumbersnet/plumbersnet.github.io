Sink problems can be a genuine inconvenience, and they can leave you thinking about what to do. If you happen to have a store vac it will be much easier to get rid of the water with it instead.  Many times you might even have the ability to unclog the drain by holding the nozzle near to the drain as you draw out the water.</p>
<p>Next, examine the body. Depending on the size and maker, the bodies can be made of bronze, plastic, stainless-steel, cast iron or ductile iron.

<h3>Clogged Sewer Line in Livermore California</h2>
<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from regular flow instructions within a piping system that is brought on by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of regular circulation in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping). Back-siphonage can occur when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is decreased main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>

If your house is over 50 years old, it's an excellent bet it's time to replace the plumbing, at a minimum cost of $2,000 and a maximum of $15,000. The broad disparity in cost is because of the size of your house, the sort of pipe you're setting up, and additional repairs you discover you need to make whenever you go behind walls.</p>
<p>There are a variety of things that can go wrong with your sewer line. Like all pipes, the sewer line will not last forever. It has remained in location since your house was developed so it has to do with the exact same age as your home. There are some things that can damage a sewer pipe such as freeze and thaw cycles and rust. Blunt force can break a pipe, such as when construction is being done at or near your home.</p>
