You 'd be hard-pressed to find a house owner grumble about the truth that they have a waste disposal unit, and many do not know what to do if they move into a house that does not have one.

<p>Changing your flapper might require slightly different steps than we reveal (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task. To find an appropriate replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Turn off the water before eliminating the flapper.) You might not discover a similar match, however chances are you'll find among the same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
