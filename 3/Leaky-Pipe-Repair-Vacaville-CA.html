<p>More than typically, little leakages in our homes are easily repaired through welding and we ignore it as a minor concern. However if the leakage concerns are frequent and every now and then some or the other corner of your home has water leaking, then it's time to call a plumber to inspect the whole piping system to perform home repiping. Several leakages shouldn't be ignored at all; else it may result in complex flooding issue soon.</p>
