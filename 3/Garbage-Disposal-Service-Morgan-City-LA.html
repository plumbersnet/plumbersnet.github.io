<p>Demand loads, no matter what their usage, need to be met by a sufficiently sized water system, which constitutes the 2nd significant component of a water supply system. With appropriate tank capability to satisfy variable peak load demand, the water supply source can provide a stable circulation of water. Throughout hours of low demand, the water flow can be used to fill up storage tanks, tanks and towers, which then provide water for emergency use and periods when need exceeds the baseline pumping rate. A supply of water source can take many forms, consisting of groundwater extraction well fields, free-flowing rivers, natural or man-made ponds, artesian springs, ocean water desalination plants, and rainwater run-off collection systems.</p>
