<p>Tip: Both anti-siphon valves and pressure vacuum breakers can not prevent back-pressure. I just recently had a number of plumbing leakages repaired and couldn't be happier with the timely service I got from Parker and Sons. They are really well-informed, friendly, reasonably priced, and do quality work. I would definitely suggest them to my family and everyone. I would trust them to repair any leak in the house.</p>
<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then leave into the sewer or septic system from your house. When you experience clogs in numerous drains at the same time in your house, then that usually suggests that your main sewer line is supporting. This can happen in multiple locations and any combination of drains. For example, water may fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several combinations of this type of backup. The point is your drains all link, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from multiple drain lines in your house.</p>
<p>Testing should be completed by a contractor signed up with the Cross Connection Control office. The contractor should have a legitimate, up-to-date plumbing license, present insurance coverage, backflow preventer testing accreditation, and currently adjusted test set. For testing of fireline backflow preventers, the State's Fire Marshal certificate is required.</p>
