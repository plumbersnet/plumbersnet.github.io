Regular obstructions, even when you're hardly washing down any food particles, might show an issue with the disposal.

<p>Loose flanges are generally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends upon the degree of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
