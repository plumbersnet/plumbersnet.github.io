<p>Lastly, the most advanced and complicated backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 individually operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. Throughout basic water streams at style pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and sophisticated (if costly) device is best used in critical areas where cross contamination might be a direct risk to life and health.</p>
