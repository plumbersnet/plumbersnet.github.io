<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>When you have a clogged piping system in your Miami, Florida properties, you can either pick a plumber who digs up your lawn, excavates the walls and destroy the structure during the pipe repairs, or you can have the insight to hire a professional such as Eco 1 Plumbing.

<p>Once a big enough source of water has actually been recognized and examined, the 3rd major element of a water supply system enters play: a system of pipelines to communicate the water from its source to its customers. The largest of these main long-distance sending pipes are referred to as aqueducts. Usually constructed of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable coating, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes developed to carry bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and circulation nodes where the flows are moved to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines. The majority of large cities need several aqueducts providing water from diverse and geographically apart sources.</p>
