A house's service line (likewise called a sewer lateral) ranges from your home to the mainline sewer in the street. In most cases, the homeowner is accountable for preserving the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is accountable for keeping the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>Then connect the drain (and dishwasher hose, if applicable). If your unit is outlet-ready-- take note of this part-- ensure your disposal switch is in the off" position prior to you plug the new unit in.
