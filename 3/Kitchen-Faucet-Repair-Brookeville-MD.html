<p>Plainly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the salt exchange websites are replaced with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to use. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
<p>It's an oddly complicated clinical procedure, however simple to treat. It utilizes salt to eliminate odors and minerals found in tough water- most commonly calcium and magnesium. Water softener systems use resin beads that bring in and connect sodium ions in the softener tank. Pumps push tough water through the resin beads exchanging solidity ions with sodium ions, softening the water.</p>
