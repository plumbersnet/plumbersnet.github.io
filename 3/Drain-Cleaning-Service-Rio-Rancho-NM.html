No, it is not a regular occurrence, however it does take place more frequently than you believe! When you don't notice the water was off for a couple of minutes, typically it takes place at night. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or hook up a brand-new pipe. This makes building jobs easily the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks utilize substantial pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants.
