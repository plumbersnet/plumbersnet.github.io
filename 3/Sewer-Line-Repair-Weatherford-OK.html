But the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is extensively pictured. If you have reasonably hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
