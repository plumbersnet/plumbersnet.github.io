Principal types consist of: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not end up being practical to manufacture till 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. developed a technique to plasticize PVC, making it simpler to process. PVC pipe began to be produced in the 1940s and remained in broad use for Drain-Waste-Vent piping during the reconstruction of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics producers in Western Europe and Japan began producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe. The approach for producing cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) was also established in the 1950s. Plastic supply pipes have become increasingly common, with a range of fittings and materials utilized.</p>
