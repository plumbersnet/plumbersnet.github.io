The majority of people dump food waste in the trash, which indicates more garbage to enter land fills or be incinerated. Besides being bad for the environment, it's frequently smelly and typically uses plastic bags to bring the waste. Worse, food waste can ferment in land fills rather of breaking down.</p>
