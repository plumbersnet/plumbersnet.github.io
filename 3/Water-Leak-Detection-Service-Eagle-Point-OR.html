It is very important to keep your drainage system in good shape. It's what keeps your house clean, safe and without water accumulation.

In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This triggers the disc to open, enabling air to restore and enter the valve pressure comparable to ambient climatic standard. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
