Variations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger a properly operating RPZ assembly to periodically release percentages of water.

<p>Water fountains and garden ponds: Automatic refills on these water functions should have either a PVB, an AVB or RP backflow preventers. These water functions are considered a health threat if backflows take place from them. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and place should be indicated on building strategies. Any backflow preventer installed on a water fountain or garden pond must be checked upon installation and then annually.</p>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people say, doesn't the water pressure in the water supply keep the watering water from going backwards? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a frequent occurrence, but it does take place more frequently than you think! Often it takes place at night when you don't discover the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a new pipe. This makes construction projects quickly the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical reason for backflow. Fire engine use big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding communities.</p>
