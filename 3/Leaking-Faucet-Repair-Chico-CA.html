If you have had plumbing service prior to planting, you may have an idea of where your lateral lies. If you do not understand, spend the very little cost to have a professional plumber find the lateral for you so that you do not make the mistake of planting over, to close, or perhaps dig into and break the line. If you are employing someone to plant for you, make certain to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that he or she will also understand the locations to avoid. If you have a clean-out, your line will be easy to determine.</p>
