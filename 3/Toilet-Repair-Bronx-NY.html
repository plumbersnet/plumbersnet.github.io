<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are set up in locations where water could trigger catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and locations with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>

<p>Your house's drainage works by the easy force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets as well) it's not actually the flow of water pressing them down your pipes.

When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>
