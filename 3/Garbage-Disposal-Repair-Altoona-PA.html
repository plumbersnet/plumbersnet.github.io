<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to a climatic vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outdoors air. This sets off the disc to open, permitting air to bring back and get in the valve pressure equivalent to ambient climatic requirement. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
