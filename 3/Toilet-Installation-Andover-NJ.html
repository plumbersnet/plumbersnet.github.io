<p>Our plumber groups aim to keep your house and work places effective, comfy and practical. Another indication your disposal requires replacement would be strange noises.

Regular blockages, even when you're hardly washing down any food particles, might indicate a problem with the disposal. It is probably due to too much usage over a long duration of time if there are leakages coming from your system. Many of these leaks can be repaired, however if they end up being bigger and more regular, you need to consider overall system replacement.</p>
<p>Then attach the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if applicable). If your system is outlet-ready-- take note of this part-- ensure your disposal switch remains in the off" position before you plug the brand-new unit in. While it's unlikely that having a disposal start up while your head is pushed versus it will cause decapitation, it may scare a number of years off your life. Not that I would know from experience.</p>
