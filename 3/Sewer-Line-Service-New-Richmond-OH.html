<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
<p>Property owners can practice preventive maintenance to avoid future drainage problems. Once a. month, use a plunger in your shower and tub drains to remove any stuck-on particles.

Another great trick is utilizing a drain strainer to stay out hair and soap residue from getting in your pipes.</p>
