In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet fixtures in houses were replaced with 1.6 - gallons per flush models. Continuous blockages: If the plunger has actually ended up being a routine fixture in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Continuous blockages show your toilet no longer has the power required to successfully get rid of waste with each flush.</p>
