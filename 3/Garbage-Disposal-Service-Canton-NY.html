<p>Without a water softener, laundry demands additional cleaning agent to avoid it from looking dingy. Dishes will come out of your dishwasher streaked and stained. Cloudy scum builds up on your shower curtains and your soap and hair shampoo will not lather. Bathing in difficult water leaves your skin itchy and dry and your hair lifeless and sticky.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he stated he would not return due to the fact that he had another appointment. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
<p>Disposers secure to the sink drain fittings in a variety of ways-some usage threaded plastic nuts, others large hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most common.

Remove the remainder of the drain assembly by loosening up the three bolts and prying off the retaining ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>
