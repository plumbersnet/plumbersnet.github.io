All assemblies need to be safeguarded from freezing temperatures and if set up where temperatures will reach 100 degrees F or above, a hot water type assembly need to be utilized.

When searching for plumbing services in the area, specify with your needs and ask prospects if they are licensed plumbers and if they have the sophisticated experience and licenses associated with a plumbing contractor.</p>
