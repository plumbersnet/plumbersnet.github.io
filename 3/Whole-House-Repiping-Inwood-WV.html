It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on really gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be inspected to ensure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close properly when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
