Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line.
