<p>Leakages are sly. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften hard water. Through a process called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Once a large enough source of water has been identified and assessed, the third major component of a supply of water system enters play: a system of pipelines to communicate the water from its source to its consumers.
