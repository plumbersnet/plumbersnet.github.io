<p>Though water line replacement seems like your home's equivalent of significant surgical treatment, it's actually something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with regularly. When your water lines are repiped, it just indicates old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We discover that houses 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing major and regular leaks, you might be in need of water line repiping. If you do have regular leaks, we find that repiping can in fact be the more affordable and better long-lasting solution.</p>

We advise you use an enzyme drain cleaner to clear slow drains. There are several advantages of using an enzyme cleaner, rather of a chemical drain cleaner.
