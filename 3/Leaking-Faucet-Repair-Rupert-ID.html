When your water lines are repiped, it simply implies old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We find that homes 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. You might be in need of water line repiping if you have an older house and are experiencing frequent and major leakages. If you do have frequent leakages, we find that repiping can actually be the more affordable and much better long-term service.</p>
