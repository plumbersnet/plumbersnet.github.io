<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound drinkable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
