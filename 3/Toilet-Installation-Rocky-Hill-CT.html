It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test dicks. A PVB might be utilized to isolate health or non-health hazards but works versus back-siphonage only.</p>

With sufficient tank capability to fulfill variable peak load demand, the water system source can offer a constant flow of water. Throughout hours of low demand, the water flow can be used to fill up storage tanks, cisterns and towers, which then supply water for emergency use and periods when demand goes beyond the standard pumping rate. A supply of water source can take numerous kinds, consisting of groundwater extraction well fields, free-flowing rivers, manufactured or natural ponds, artesian springs, ocean water desalination plants, and rainwater run-off collection systems.</p>
