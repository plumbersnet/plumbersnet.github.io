<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a variety of materials were utilized for house plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was used for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are long lasting in the short-term, they degrade over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are susceptible to various types of rust. After about fifty years, they'll start to damage from rust and may put toxic substances into the freshwater supply. We recommend changing the steel, clay, and iron pipes in your home. This may not require entirely repiping your house, considering that newer materials may have already been utilized in some areas, such as the bathroom plumbing. A professional plumber can help you pinpoint precisely what work needs to be done.</p>
