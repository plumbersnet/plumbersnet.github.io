Handling fixing a burst pipe is definitely not worth the savings sustained from utilizing a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is extensively pictured. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
