If you have inside-the-wall supply pipes that require replacement, your plumber might have the ability to limit the wall demolition he requires to do by utilizing an alternative piping product: Cross-linked polyethylene tubing, also called PEX, is a versatile plastic hose.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible water system line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can actually trigger leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If needed, check for leakages and tighten them a bit more.</p>
