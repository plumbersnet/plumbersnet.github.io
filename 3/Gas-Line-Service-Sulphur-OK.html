<p>Backflow is the undesirable turnaround of flow in a safe and clean water distribution system. Water that is constantly under pressure can only flow in one instructions. Then how can water flow in reverse? Water will always flow towards the point of least expensive pressure.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants tried the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another consultation, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
