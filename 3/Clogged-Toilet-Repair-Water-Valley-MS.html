<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line.
