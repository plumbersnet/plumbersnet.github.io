Rather than dislodging the clog with negative pressure, it in fact presses into the obstruction, working further into where the obstruction is taking place. The auger or snake" is then utilized to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear path for water to stream easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps require it even more down into the clog, making it easier to clear.</p>
