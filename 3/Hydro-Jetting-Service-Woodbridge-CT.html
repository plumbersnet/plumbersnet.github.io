When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated appropriately. It can also cause the system to leak if the bypass valve is broken. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that might need to be re-lubricated or changed over time.
