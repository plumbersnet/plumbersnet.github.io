<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Deatsville AL</h3>
<p>The standard work week for plumbers is 40 hours (8 hours a day, 5 days a week). Similar to many professions in building and construction, there are peak durations that will require you to work overtime. The variety of extra hours you work weekly depends on the construction sector and area you work in, and will vary from one task to the next. Over time, the limescale buildup brought on by tough water can lead to costly plumbing repairs. A RainSoft water conditioner can help prevent premature wear and tear on your toilet.</p>
<p>Replacing your flapper may need slightly various steps than we reveal (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job if you have an unusual flush valve. To discover a suitable replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Shut off the water before getting rid of the flapper.) You might not find an identical match, but chances are you'll locate among the same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
