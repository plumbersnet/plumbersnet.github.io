<p>Though water line replacement seems like your house's equivalent of significant surgery, it's really something we at Gotelli Plumbing handle frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it just suggests old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with brand-new pipes. We discover that homes 15 years or older who have actually never had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing major and regular leakages, you could be in need of water line repiping. We find that repiping can really be the less expensive and better long-term solution if you do have frequent leaks.</p>
