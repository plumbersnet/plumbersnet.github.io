If there is a leak, one thing to know about gas lines is they can be extremely unsafe. While gas leakages are rare, you need to leave the structure instantly if you observe a smell like rotten eggs in your home.

<p>Drains, drains and waste piping are checked for proper grading to maintain downward flow. The plumbing system is tested for leaks. We check that the material used in the plumbing system is approved by a recognized testing laboratory. We restrict cross connections between safe water and water from a questionable source and restrict the discharge of contaminated materials to the sewer system. We likewise examine the vent pipes to stabilize the pressure in the plumbing system.</p>
