<p>A cross-connection is any temporary or permanent connection between a public water system or customer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system including nonpotable water or other compounds. An example is the piping between a public water system or customer's drinkable water system and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>
