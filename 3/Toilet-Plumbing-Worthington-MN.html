<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water system. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or decreased pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
