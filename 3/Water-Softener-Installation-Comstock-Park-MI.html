<p>Once you've discovered the journey lever you want, all you really need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) remove your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and loosen it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Keep in mind that due to the fact that of the way a lever works, the locknuts for many toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the proper method. When you have actually protected the journey lever and are ready to hook up your flapper, make sure you've got just enough slack in the chain to ensure the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
