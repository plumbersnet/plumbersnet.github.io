Roll plumber's putty between your hands into a rope the size of a pencil and cover it around the lip of the kitchen sink drain opening.

<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly imagined. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
