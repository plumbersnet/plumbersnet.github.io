Paper towels can rapidly block the toilet drain line or cause a clog further down the drainpipe. Womanly hygiene products need to be gotten rid of in the garbage and never in the toilet.</p>
<p>You depend on your drains to bring wastewater from your sink, shower or tub. Over time, the drains become clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more.
