<p>A toilet auger works the opposite way that a plunger does. Instead of dislodging the clog with unfavorable pressure, it actually presses into the blockage, working even more into where the obstruction is taking place. The auger or snake" is then used to push the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to stream freely. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps require it even more down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
<p>Disadvantages to be aware of is that hybrid water heaters need to be set up in an area that stays in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well.
