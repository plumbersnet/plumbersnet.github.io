<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some elements might have extremely tight tolerances that need to be kept. An important thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a very crucial part of the design of each component. If the element is not repaired appropriately, the guide could limit the motion (instead of direct or constant) of the element, which could cause the component to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In most cases the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
