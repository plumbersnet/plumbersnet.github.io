<p>Plastic pipe remains in wide usage for domestic supply of water and drain-waste-vent (DWV) pipe. Principal types consist of: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was produced experimentally in the 19th century but did not become useful to make until 1926, when Waldo Semon of BF Goodrich Co. established a technique to plasticize PVC, making it much easier to process. PVC pipe began to be made in the 1940s and was in large use for Drain-Waste-Vent piping during the restoration of Germany and Japan following WWII. In the 1950s, plastics manufacturers in Western Europe and Japan started producing acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) pipe.

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal service is to have the faulty pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is a choice to think about if you live in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for numerous decades, however steel eventually struggles with deterioration and does not have the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
