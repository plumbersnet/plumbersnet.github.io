This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA suggests that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) needs to not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not cause this type of rust A softener is just catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (generally salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
<p>Disadvantages to be familiar with is that hybrid hot water heater need to be set up in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well.

Likewise, hybrids need up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to capture enough heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to discharge the condensate.</p>
