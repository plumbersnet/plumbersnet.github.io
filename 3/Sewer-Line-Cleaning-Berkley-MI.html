The biggest of these main long-distance sending pipes are referred to as aqueducts. Generally built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impermeable finishing, these are substantial underground and aboveground pipes created to bring bulk circulation amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and circulation nodes where the circulations are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines. Many large cities need a number of aqueducts supplying water from geographically apart and diverse sources.</p>
