If the element is not repaired properly, the guide could limit the motion (instead of stable or direct) of the element, which might cause the part to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
