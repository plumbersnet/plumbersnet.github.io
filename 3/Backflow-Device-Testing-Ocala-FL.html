<p>Responsive circulation innovation works by continuously bringing tanks off-line and online in response to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, only one of the 4 tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. Nevertheless, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive style allows the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than traditional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange website. When all the salt exchange websites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regrowth. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt option. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to utilize once backwashing is total. Some water softeners will automatically switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regrowth.</p>
