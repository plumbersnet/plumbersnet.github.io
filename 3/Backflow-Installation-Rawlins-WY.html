<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and avoid it from working. This is referred to as fouling. Often it might be needed to filter the water before it gets to your softener to avoid fouling. If the resin becomes fouled, commercial cleaners are readily available. Cleaners need to be utilized according to manufacturer instructions to avoid contamination.</p>
<p>Replacing your flapper may need somewhat various actions than we show (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job if you have an uncommon flush valve. To find an ideal replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water before eliminating the flapper.) You may not discover a similar match, but chances are you'll find one of the exact same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
