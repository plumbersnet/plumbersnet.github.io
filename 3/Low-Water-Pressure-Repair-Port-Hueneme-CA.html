<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have reasonably hard water, for example five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily sodium intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of salt added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
