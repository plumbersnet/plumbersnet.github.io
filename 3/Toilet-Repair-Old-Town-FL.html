<p>In the 1990 â€² s, drought conditions motivated water companies to implement water preservation programs in California. In these programs, older 3.5 and 6.0 - gallons per flush toilet components in houses were changed with 1.6 - gallons per flush designs. Constant blockages: If the plunger has actually ended up being a regular component in your bathroom, it's time for a replacement. Continuous blockages indicate your toilet no longer has actually the power required to effectively eliminate waste with each flush.</p>
