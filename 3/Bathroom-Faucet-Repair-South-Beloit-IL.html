Also replace the old shutoff valve with a new ball valve while you're at it (Picture 6). Vent sizes are sized according to the heat output of the hot water heater. You may need to increase or decrease the vent size to guarantee the best draft. CAUTION: If you're not sure if your chimney has a liner, ask your plumbing inspector.</p>
<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is really low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an incredibly pure type of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
