<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a severe public health hazard if they do not have sufficient backflow prevention assemblies set up.

<h3>Backflow Prevention Device Replacement & Installation in Hialeah Florida</h2>

<p>Depending upon the degree of the clog, we might use a range of different methods, the most typical being hydro-jetting. Hydro-jetting is a sophisticated form of drain cleaning where we use water under high pressure to totally clear out everything inside your drains. Lay the waste disposal unit on its side and get rid of the electrical cover plate from the bottom. Loosen the green ground screw and get rid of wire adapters. Detach waste disposal unit wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen up screws on the electrical clamp connector and remove wires from the garbage disposal.</p>
<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to an atmospheric vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outdoors air. This triggers the disc to open, allowing air to restore and go into the valve pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric requirement. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
