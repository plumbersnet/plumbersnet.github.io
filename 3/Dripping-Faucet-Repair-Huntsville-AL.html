<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound potable water supply, backpressure backflow in a building results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to an interruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To prevent backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
