<p>Backflow is water flowing in the opposite instructions from its regular flow. IRWD's safe and clean water supply is developed to keep the water streaming to you.

<p>Water pressure need to be checked at least as soon as a year or whenever you have a plumber in your home.

A pressure-reducing device in proper working order is extremely important to preserving a healthy water delivery system in your house. Water pressure should never go beyond 80 psi. Anything reading above 80 psi. is a sign of a failing water pressure-reducing device and need to be attended to as quickly as possible.
