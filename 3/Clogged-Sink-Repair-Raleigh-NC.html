<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair in Raleigh NC 27610</h3>
<p>I bought a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, since I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned up from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months earlier. I feel that costs were increased because I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March said depending upon the market and seriousness of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my past receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>

<p>Within commercial centers, DCV and RPZ backflow prevention systems need to be examined, maintained, and tested with consistency.

Each backflow prevention system requires different testing procedures and intervals, and demands substantial experience and knowledge.</p>
