<p>A water softener has two tanks: a mineral tank and a salt water tank. The mineral tank is where the actual ion exchange, or water softening, takes place. It's filled with small, negatively-charged polystyrene beads called resin or zeolite. The salt water tank is where the salt, or salt, is saved and combined with water. If you plan to drain  your automatic dishwasher through your disposer, locate the breakout plate inside the inlet port (Image 1). Eliminate it by gently punching it with a screwdriver and hammer (Image 2). Leave the breakout plate undamaged if you will not utilize your unit to drain a dishwasher.</p>

The thermal growth needs to leave, hence the need for a growth tank to help regulate the pressure. The force put in by the growth taking location when boiling the water triggers the reservoir to break and begin leaking if the tank is old and used out. The remedy for this is to replace the hot water heater unit.</p>
