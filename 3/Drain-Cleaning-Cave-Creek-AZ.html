<p>Hard water usage may impact the efficiency of household home appliances. When heated up, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the hot water heater. A large scale accumulation slows the heating process and needs more energy to heat water. Water heaters with large build-ups of mineral accumulation will have a shorter life expectancy. Scale deposits also accumulate to plug plumbing fixtures and build up in other appliances such as coffee pots and dishwashers, hence affecting their performance.</p>
