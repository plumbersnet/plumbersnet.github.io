<p>Camera are one of the most important tools in the plumbing company.

For water pressure to be sufficient, the lines must be 3/4" to one inch directly from the main water source for the home. The pipes themselves should be at least a 1/2" in diameter to offer appropriate flow.</p>
<p>Next, recognize that unless your water is exceptionally difficult, all the inbound water does not need to be softened. Showers, sinks, and laundry hookups probably must be softened; toilets, outside spigots, and basement sinks can be bypassed. Sometimes, you might desire to soften the warm water just.
