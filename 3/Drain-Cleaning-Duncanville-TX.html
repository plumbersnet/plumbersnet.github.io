<h3>Hour Emergency Plumbing Service Duncanville TX</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back against the required direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the local water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the sprinkler system can become contaminated. If allowed to return to the water supply, there is potential for the infected water to become a health danger. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for effectiveness, as well as inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a way or mechanism to avoid backflow. The fundamental means of preventing backflow is an air space, which either eliminates a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The basic mechanism for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which offers a physical barrier to backflow. The primary types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
