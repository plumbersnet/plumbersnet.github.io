While chemical drain cleaners may be an inexpensive option, the severe components rust your inner drain pipe, over time, creating weak points in the pipe that are likely to rupture. Dealing with repairing a burst pipe is certainly not worth the savings incurred from utilizing a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is a remarkably pure type of water. When water evaporates it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
