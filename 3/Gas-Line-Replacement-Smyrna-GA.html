Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created because of the process. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals.
