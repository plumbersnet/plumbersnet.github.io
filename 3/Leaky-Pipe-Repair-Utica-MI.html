<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Utica MI</h3>
<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
