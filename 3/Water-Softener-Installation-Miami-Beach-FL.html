<p>Backflow preventers are vital for producing a safe supply of water system. Due to the fact that they're less vulnerable to rust, stainless steel blades are usually preferred. Other excellent options are overload defense, which shuts off the motor if it begins to get too hot; an auto-reverse feature to avoid jamming; and a dishwasher-drain connection so food particles from the filthy dishes get ground up in the disposal.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He stated he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Since he had another appointment, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
