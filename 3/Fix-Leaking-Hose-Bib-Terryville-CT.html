<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of 2 categories. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will restore on an established schedule and then go back to service. These work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt since they regrow whether the resin needs it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, typically restore after so many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a rising and falling water use schedule, such models are convenient.</p>

<p>This article intends to address the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes corrosion This is not the case: an effectively set up water softener does not make the cured water more destructive. Here are a few complicated facts that frequently lead individuals to this erroneous conclusion. First, naturally soft water is usually corrosive. For that reason, softened water must also be corrosive, ideal? This is a misconception due to the fact that naturally soft water tends to be corrosive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening triggers neither of these conditions.</p>
