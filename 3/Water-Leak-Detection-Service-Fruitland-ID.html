The policy was not strictly imposed until a push in current years by the DEP's Cross-Connection Control Program, an initiative that includes routine random inspections of New York City buildings to make sure they remain in compliance.</p>

Normally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product coated with positively charged salt ions.
