<p>The majority of demand for plumbers will stem from new construction and the need to keep and repair plumbing systems in existing residences and other buildings. Work of sprinklerfitters is expected to increase as states continue to adopt changes to constructing codes that need the use of fire suppression systems. It's most likely that the new system will fit the existing bracket if there was an existing disposal connected to the sink already. If not-- or if there is no disposal presently in location-- start by eliminating the old drain.
