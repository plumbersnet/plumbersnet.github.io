<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Lithonia GA</h3>
<p>All water supply systems consist of a number of major components. The first major factor is the water demand load by the population being serviced. Though this is not necessarily a physical thing, it drives the style and installation of all other components in the water system system Water demand differs on a per capita basis in addition to season. Summertime is generally a greater demand duration than winter since individual usage of water increases with heat, lawn and garden irrigation, leisure swimming pools, etc</p>
<p>Water softening describes the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular technique of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- generally sodium. The outcome is water that's been successfully softened by getting rid of almost all traces of the minerals that make up difficult water.</p>
