<h3>Clogged Garbage Disposal in Forest Hills New York</h2>
<p>Is your drain clogged with particles, hair, or toilet paper? After years of use, drains can gather harmful accumulation. This build-up blocks water circulation, ultimately backing up your drains till they are unusable. Generally, all the pipes need is a good scrubbing. We can achieve this through a range of methods such as snaking the drain, mini-jetting, grease trap cleaning, or hydro jetting.</p>
<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers and that may do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he left with no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another appointment, they called him back and he said he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
