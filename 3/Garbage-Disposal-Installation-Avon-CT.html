<p>Prior to installing, your professional will shut off water and electrical power to the area. Next, the old sink flange is eliminated and cleaned of any putty residue.

<p>The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you turn the switch, however it doesn't grind up food, this implies the flywheel is stuck.
