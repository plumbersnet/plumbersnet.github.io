<h3>How to Remove a Sink Drain Pop Up in Auburn WA 98092</h3>
<p>I acquired a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, given that I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper only cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months ago. I feel that prices were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March said depending on the market and severity of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Embarassment on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>

<p>The labor expenses for disposal installation are mostly time related. If whatever is all set, in good condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely just charge for an hour or two of time. If things need to be modified, changed, or transferred to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours required and therefore the overall expenses. Most plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with many disposal installations running $50 per hour for three hours overall, making the labor costs approximately $150.</p>
