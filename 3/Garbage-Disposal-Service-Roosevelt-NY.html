<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers which might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As quickly as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another consultation, they called him back and he said he would not come back.
