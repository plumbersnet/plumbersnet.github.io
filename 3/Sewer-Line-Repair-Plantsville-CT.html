<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings instead of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back due to the fact that he had another visit. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>

<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services Plantsville CT</h3>
<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing stoppage service might seem like a waste of money. Why invest in professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will suffice? While chemical drain cleaners might be a low-cost service, the extreme active ingredients rust your inner drain pipe, gradually, producing vulnerable points in the pipe that are most likely to burst. Handling repairing a burst pipe is certainly not worth the cost savings incurred from using a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to method when searching for a viable option, specifically when simple plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are lots of drawbacks to using these hazardous products - not least of which is that they generally contain compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, however at the cost of providing the danger of damage to your house and family.</p>
