<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Services Umatilla OR</h3>
<p>A recently set up hot water heater ought to not produce unusual noises, but it will start to create rumbling sounds as it ages. The sounds get louder gradually as the heater goes to heat up the water. Things worsen considerably for households with a high need for warm water. The reasons for the sounds can be the accumulation of sediments in the tank which need to be flushed to restore normalcy. A hot water heater replacement may be needed if the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has actually been flushed.</p>
<p>This post intends to attend to the typical misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes rust This is not the case: a properly configured water softener does not make the treated water more corrosive. Here are a couple of confusing realities that often lead people to this incorrect conclusion. Initially, naturally soft water is generally corrosive. For that reason, softened water must also be destructive, right? This is a misconception since naturally soft water tends to be destructive due to low pH and low TDS, while cation -exchange softening causes neither of these conditions.</p>
