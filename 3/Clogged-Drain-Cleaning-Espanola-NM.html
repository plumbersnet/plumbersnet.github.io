<p>Once the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair procedure. It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on extremely slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air should be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be checked to guarantee no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close properly. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
