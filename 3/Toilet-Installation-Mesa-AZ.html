<p>These valves have a great deal of versatility. They're the least expensive of the backflow prevention options, however they also provide the least amount of protection. A climatic vacuum breaker, likewise referred to as an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a floating disc. When pressurized and drops to enable air to enter the downstream piping when depressurized, this disc increases and seals off the air inlet.</p>
