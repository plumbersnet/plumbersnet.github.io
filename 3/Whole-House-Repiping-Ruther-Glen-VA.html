Frequent obstructions, even when you're hardly washing down any food particles, could show a problem with the disposal. It is probably due to too much usage over a long period of time if there are leakages coming from your system. A lot of these leakages can be repaired, but if they end up being bigger and more frequent, you must consider overall system replacement.</p>
