<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and eliminate water particles from the solution with firmness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to confess water particles for passage; firmness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is without firmness ions without any other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter needing regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
