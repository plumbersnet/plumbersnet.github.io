<p>When the hardware parts have actually been cleaned up and checked and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to determine on each part is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the motion of the component. The guide is a very vital part of the design of each element. If the part is not repaired correctly, the guide could limit the movement (rather than direct or consistent) of the part, which might cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. For the most part the guides are restricting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
