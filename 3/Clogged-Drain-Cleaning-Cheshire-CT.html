<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Cheshire CT</h3>
<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to dig up your lawn. During a camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images recorded by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when searching for a feasible service, particularly when simple plunging does not appear to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of drawbacks to using these dangerous items - not least of which is that they generally contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the danger of harm to your home and family.</p>
