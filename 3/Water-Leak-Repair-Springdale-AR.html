<p>Backflow is the unwanted turnaround of circulation in a safe and clean water distribution system. Water that is always under pressure can only stream in one direction. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will always flow towards the point of least expensive pressure.

The demand upstream could cause a turnaround in circulation.</p>

<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal circulation instructions within a piping system that is caused by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of regular circulation in a system caused by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water supply piping). Back-siphonage can occur when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
