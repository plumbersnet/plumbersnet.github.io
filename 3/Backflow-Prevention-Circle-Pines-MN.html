<p>Last but not least, the most complex and sophisticated backflow preventer is the reduced pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than five separately running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other 4. During basic water flows at design pressure, the two check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if expensive) device is best used in important areas where cross contamination could be a direct danger to life and health.</p>

<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one ought to initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical malfunctions of softener components. When these components are not the reason for the unsatisfactory water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or perhaps even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. When all the ions are totally exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>
