<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water innovation start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, announced today they have achieved a development in water softening treatment utilizing a proprietary Surface Accelerated Crystallization (SACr) technology.

In most cases, elimination will only include an additional $25 to $50 to the total expenses, but sometimes the expenses could be greater if extra pipes should also be changed.</p>
