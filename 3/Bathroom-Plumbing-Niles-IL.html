<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is widely imagined. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day sodium intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
