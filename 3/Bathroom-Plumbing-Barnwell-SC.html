<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product coated with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the unit while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts need to be gotten rid of and changed with brand-new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is important that just initial factory repair parts are utilized.
