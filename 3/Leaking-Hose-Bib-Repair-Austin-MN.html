If you have an unusual flush valve, finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task. To find an ideal replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.)

If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
