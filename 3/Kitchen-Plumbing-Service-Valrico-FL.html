<p>A backflow preventer is a way or system to prevent backflow. The basic ways of preventing backflow is an air gap, which either removes a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow.

<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, but he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he could not simply fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no more repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there considering that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. Due to the fact that he had another appointment, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
