The biggest of these main long-distance sending pipes are described as aqueducts. Usually built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe sections, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finish, these are big underground and aboveground pipes designed to bring bulk circulation amounts of water to treatment plants, secondary storage centers and distribution nodes where the flows are moved to smaller-sized branch distribution pipelines.

<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back against the needed instructions of flow. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being infected. There is potential for the polluted water to become a health threat if permitted to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected routinely for effectiveness, as well as examined yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
