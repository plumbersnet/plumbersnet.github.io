<p>When the water does not end up being soft enough, one must first think about problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these elements are not the reason for the unacceptable water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners eliminate the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in hard water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new salt ions.</p>
<p>Responsive circulation technology works by continuously bringing tanks off-line and on-line in action to the water demands of your carwash. For instance, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive flow technology, only one of the 4 tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. Nevertheless, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive design enables the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than conventional single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
<p>The EcoWater ESS1152 Series are non-resin based systems that can be customized to your water needs. Your EcoWater Pro will evaluate your water to figure out the right water treatment for your house. Due to the fact that the softener's salt water tank nests inside of the salt tank, a single tank or cabinet-style system requires less space. The CareSoft ® system was developed with the exact same innovative engineering as the Pro and Elite models, with resin that provides high-performance solidity elimination you can rely on for years to come.</p>
