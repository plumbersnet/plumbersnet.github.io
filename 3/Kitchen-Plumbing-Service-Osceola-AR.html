<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical procedure filters the water through an exchange media known as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a artificial or natural , sand-like product covered with favorably charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water streams through the system while the resin releases its salt ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>

Without constant testing and maintenance, these systems can allow infected water to stream easily within your supply pipes, producing a severe health threat to building occupants. Each backflow prevention system requires various testing treatments and periods, and needs considerable experience and understanding.</p>
