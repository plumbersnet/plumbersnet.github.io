<p>Camera are one of the most valuable tools in the plumbing company. Identify the size of the water pipes in the home and around the house - they will help to identify the water pressure that you'll have. For water pressure to be sufficient, the lines need to be 3/4" to one inch straight from the main water source for the home. The pipes themselves ought to be at least a 1/2" in diameter to provide sufficient flow.</p>
<p>Inspect to ensure it's not your waste disposal unit that's triggering the issue. A clogged disposal can stop up the drain, so run the disposal to see if that clears the clog. Then check it to make sure it's running correctly. If the disposal has overheated, you may need to turn the switch found on the side or bottom of the unit underneath the sink.</p>

<p>No hot water-- The lack of warm water is the greatest indication that there is something incorrect with your San Antonio hot water heater. If you aren't getting sufficient warm water for your shower, then you might have sediment that has actually built up in the unit and separated the water from the heat source. If your water heater isn't doing its only job, it's time to speak with the experts.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the firmness minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly envisioned. If you have reasonably tough water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
