<p>The concern of leak can be credited to any variety of factors which can range from the tank is old and worn out, to over-pressurization, along with poor maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank must have some room to account for the growth that takes place. The thermal expansion needs to escape, hence the need for an expansion tank to help control the pressure. The force put in by the expansion taking location when boiling the water causes the tank to split and start leaking if the tank is old and worn out. The solution for this is to replace the hot water heater unit.</p>
