<h3>How To Stop Emergency Plumbing Water Damages Deerfield IL</h3>
<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic rust Direct contact in between dissimilar metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is developed because of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly linked to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to alleviate this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling includes an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
