<p>Most demand for plumbers will come from new construction and the need to maintain and repair plumbing systems in existing residences and other structures. Employment of sprinklerfitters is expected to increase as states continue to adopt modifications to constructing codes that require using fire suppression systems. It's likely that the brand-new system will fit the existing bracket if there was an existing disposal connected to the sink already. If not-- or if there is no disposal presently in place-- start by eliminating the old drain. Many drains are attached to the sink by a big nut beneath the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen.</p>

<p>Changing your flapper might need slightly different steps than we show (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task. To discover a suitable replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water before getting rid of the flapper.) You may not find an identical match, but possibilities are you'll find among the same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
