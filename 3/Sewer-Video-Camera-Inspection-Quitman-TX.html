<p>Changing your flapper may require somewhat different steps than we reveal (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job if you have an unusual flush valve. To discover a suitable replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Turn off the water before removing the flapper.) You may not discover a similar match, but opportunities are you'll find among the very same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
