<h3>Water Heater Issues and Repair in Notre Dame IN 46556</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
