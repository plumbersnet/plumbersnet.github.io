However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams.
