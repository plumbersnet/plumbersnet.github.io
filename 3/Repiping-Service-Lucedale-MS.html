<p>But is a plumbing catastrophe impending or just a concern for the long run? Changing old pipes in a 1,500 square foot, two-bathroom house costs $4,000 to $10,000, and needs cutting open walls and floors, so you certainly don't want to do the job before it's necessary. Here's how to examine your plumbing system and understand when it's time for replacement.</p>
<p>If there are any lead pipes in the house, discover out. Homes that were constructed prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how helpful, is an environmental toxic substance (note the need for unleaded gasoline and paint in houses that is not lead based). If you have kids, you might not want to live in a house that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>Pro Idea: If you're going to be draining a dishwasher through the system, now is the very best time to eliminate the knockout plug inside the dishwasher inlet. Utilize a hammer to tap a screwdriver into the inlet till the plug is broken off; recover the little piece of plastic from inside the disposer. This is also the perfect time to make the connections for a hardwired system with a pre-existing junction box.</p>
