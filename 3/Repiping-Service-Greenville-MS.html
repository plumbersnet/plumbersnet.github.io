<h3>Things To Know Before Hiring A Sewer Cleaning Company at Greenville MS 38701</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
