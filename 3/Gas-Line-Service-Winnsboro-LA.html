<p>The list of things a food disposer can consume is relatively brief. Soft or crisp foods are great, however difficult or stringy foods can be trouble. Disposers can be stopped in their tracks by celery, eggshells and apple seeds, as well as the usual kitchen flotsam, consisting of pop-tabs, scouring pads and twist-ties. While some older homes may not have backflow preventers, all newer homes are required to have them.

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you've been recommended by a medical professional to follow a strict low sodium diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
