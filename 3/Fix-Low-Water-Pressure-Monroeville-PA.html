<p>Stegle says that when they are dealing with a client on a custom house, they will work directly with the house owner when it pertains to selecting faucets and other fixtures.

<p>Plainly the resin is not an endless exchange site. When all the salt exchange websites are changed with solidity minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be worked on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt service. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. When backwashing is complete, the softener can be gone back to utilize. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
