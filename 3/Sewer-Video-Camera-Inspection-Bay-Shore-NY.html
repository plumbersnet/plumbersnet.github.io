<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply. Backpressure can be triggered by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when unfavorable or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure.
