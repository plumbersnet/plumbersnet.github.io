This can increase the amount of time needed to install the new system, therefore increasing expenses. This really depends on what condition the remainder of the pipes remain in, and how hard the old unit is to remove. In many cases, elimination will just add an additional $25 to $50 to the overall expenses, but in many cases the expenses might be greater if extra pipes should also be changed.</p>
