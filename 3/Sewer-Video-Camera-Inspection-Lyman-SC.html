However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a regular occurrence, however it does occur more frequently than you think! When you don't see the water was off for a few minutes, typically it occurs at night. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a brand-new pipe. This makes construction tasks easily the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire battling is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks use big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding communities.</p>
