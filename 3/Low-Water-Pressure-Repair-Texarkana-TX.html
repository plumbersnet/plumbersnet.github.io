Many components can not be re-installed into the body unless the test dicks are left open. As each element is put back into the body, it is essential to put them back in the appropriate location. It is likewise essential that as they are put back into the body, that no contaminant is connected on the elements or unintentionally put in the body.

<p>Drawbacks to be aware of is that hybrid water heaters need to be installed in an area that stays between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need as much as 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, since the heat pump is on top of the water heater. Likewise, hybrids require approximately 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled space to record enough heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
