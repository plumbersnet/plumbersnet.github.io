<p>Mineral deposits get captured on the sides of a pipe and harden. Over time, the deposits accumulate, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to pass through your pipes.

If you wish to make two times as sure your toilet is the issue prior to you replace it, you could have your drain pipes professionally cleaned. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still clogs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
