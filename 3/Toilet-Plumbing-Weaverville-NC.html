<p>If the water heater leaks or burst, high water pressure likewise leads to thermal expansion in water heaters which can lead to possible water damage.

<p>If the water feels warm, then the heating component is taking longer to warm the water than it should. But this specific problem is when you have no hot water streaming in your home. The reasons for this can range from leakages, faulty or malfunctioning electrical circuitry, or a broken heating component or thermostat.
