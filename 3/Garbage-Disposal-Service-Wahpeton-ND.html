<p>It is essential to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger a properly working RPZ assembly to occasionally discharge small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a large volume of water will flow from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in locations based on water damage. Adequate drainage should also be offered.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly envisioned. If you have reasonably tough water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday sodium consumption. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
