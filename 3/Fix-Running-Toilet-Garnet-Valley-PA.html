<p>Your sewer line is one of the most vital parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes broken or clogged, it might wreak unwelcome issues on your residential or commercial property. A home's service line (also known as a sewer lateral) ranges from the house to the mainline sewer in the street. Most of the times, the property owner is accountable for maintaining the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is accountable for keeping the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>

<p>Lastly, the most advanced and complex backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 independently operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other four. Throughout standard water flows at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if costly) device is best used in vital locations where cross contamination could be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
