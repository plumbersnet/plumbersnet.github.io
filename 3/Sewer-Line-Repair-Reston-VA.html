Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another consultation, they called him back and he stated he would not come back.
