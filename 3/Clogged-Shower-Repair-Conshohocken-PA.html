<p>The problem of leak can be credited to any number of factors which can range from the tank is old and worn, to over-pressurization, along with bad maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank ought to have some room to account for the growth that takes place. The thermal expansion needs to get away, hence the need for a growth tank to help manage the pressure. If the tank is old and worn out, the force put in by the growth happening when boiling the water triggers the tank to break and begin leaking. The treatment for this is to replace the water heater unit.</p>
