<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Tilton NH</h3>
<p>Though water line replacement seems like your home's equivalent of major surgical treatment, it's really something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it simply indicates old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We discover that homes 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing significant and frequent leaks, you might be in need of water line repiping. We find that repiping can really be the less expensive and much better long-term option if you do have frequent leaks.</p>
