<p>In water system systems, water is normally kept at a significant pressure to enable water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might stop working or be minimized when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is an all of a sudden high demand on the water system (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe might permit contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>

Understanding the right order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be important.</p>
