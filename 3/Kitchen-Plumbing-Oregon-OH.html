<p>All you truly need to do is (CAREFULLY!) once you have actually discovered the trip lever you want eliminate your tank cover, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old journey lever was and protect it. Remember that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make certain you're turning things the correct way. When you've secured the trip lever and are all set to link your flapper, ensure you've got simply enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the way when you lower on the trip lever.</p>
