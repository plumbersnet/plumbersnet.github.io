<p>Backpressure backflow in a building results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the inbound potable supply of water. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A typical type of backflow preventer is the minimized pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
