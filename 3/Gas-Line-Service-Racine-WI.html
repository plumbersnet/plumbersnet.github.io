<p>Your disposer may include a thin rubber gasket to be used under the sink flange, rather of the conventional plumber's putty as described listed below. Both will produce a good seal (though the gasket may lead to small amounts of water collecting around the flange), and what's utilized is mainly a matter of preference. Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's harder to eliminate.</p>
<p>The water utilized to restore the softener beads ends up as waste. Other signs that your drain line must be cleaned up include odd smells emanating from the drain itself, reduced water pressure from the tap, or overflowing water or waste from a sink or toilet.
