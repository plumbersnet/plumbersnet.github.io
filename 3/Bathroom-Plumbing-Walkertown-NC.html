<p>The majority of houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to rust. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather condition defense. As the outer covering of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
