Instead of needing to put the waste into the garbage, where it could potentially end up in a land fill, garbage disposals let you grind the waste up into small particles that can be flushed to the septic tank or sewer.</p>
<p>Switch on the gas and examine connections for leakages by brushing a 50-50 mixture of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. If the mixture bubbles, you have a leak. Tighten or reconnect joints that leak. When completed, clean the joints dry. Call the plumbing inspector to check out your work. Follow the how-to guidance that accompanies the photos to ensure the connections are tight.</p>

While most kitchen sink disposers can deal with almost any type of food waste, they are not unbreakable.

Used impellers on older disposals can become ineffective, increasing the risk of drain obstructions.</p>
