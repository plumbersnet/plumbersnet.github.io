<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
