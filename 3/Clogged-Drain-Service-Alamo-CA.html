<p>Light Blue = Lowered Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Examine spring (for example, to 90 psi).

Once again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub.
