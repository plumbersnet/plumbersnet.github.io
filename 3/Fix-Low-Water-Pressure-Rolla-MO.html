<p>Mixing vaporized salt with rock salt is not advised, as this might clog the softening reservoir. It is advised that you permit your unit to go empty of one type of salt prior to adding another to avoid the occurrence of any problems. In any case, when you're preparing a water heater replacement, play it safe. Call your local department of inspections and ask if you need a permit. And make certain a plumbing or electrical inspector checks your work.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health danger for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is minor, however if you've been recommended by a physician to follow a stringent low salt diet this increase can posture problems.</p>

<p>As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will build up in various parts of the plumbing system, a lot of typically in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can trigger low circulation problems or even stop a fixture from flowing entirely.
