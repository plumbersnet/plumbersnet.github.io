<h3>Affordable Plumbing Services Salinas CA</h3>
<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
<p>If your disposal's installation will require a brand-new installing flange in the sink, you'll need to install that first. If you're changing an old disposer, remove it as talked about above.

Take your new trip lever, place it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it. Bear in mind that due to the fact that of the method a lever works, the locknuts for the majority of toilet trip levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the right method.
