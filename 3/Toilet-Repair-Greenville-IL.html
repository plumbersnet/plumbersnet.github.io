<p>A backflow preventer is a method or mechanism to avoid backflow. The fundamental means of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either removes a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The basic mechanism for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which offers a physical barrier to backflow.
