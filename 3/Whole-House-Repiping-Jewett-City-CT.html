Bio-Clean is an all-natural option that's both harmless to your plumbing and incredibly reliable at removing gunk, waste, and organic product that so often clogs up your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, corroding the sidewalls and only partially fixing the problem. Bio-Clean is a service of live germs that actively seek out natural product and eat away at it, creating safe byproducts of carbon dioxide, water, and mineral ash, all of which are easily treated at local sewage plants.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI.

The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove debris such as difficult water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>
