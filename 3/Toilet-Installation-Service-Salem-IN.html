<p>A lot of need for plumbers will come from new building and construction and the need to repair and maintain plumbing systems in existing residences and other buildings. Employment of sprinklerfitters is expected to increase as states continue to adopt changes to developing codes that require using fire suppression systems. It's likely that the brand-new unit will fit the existing bracket if there was an existing disposal connected to the sink already. If not-- or if there is no disposal presently in place-- start by getting rid of the old drain. Most drains are connected to the sink by a large nut underneath the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen.</p>
