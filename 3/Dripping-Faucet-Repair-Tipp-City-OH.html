<p>In the first half of the twentieth century, a variety of products were utilized for home plumbing. Galvanized steel and cast iron were the most common metals, while clay was utilized for sewer line piping. Although all these materials are resilient in the short-term, they weaken over decades. Both galvanized steel and cast iron are susceptible to many different kinds of rust. After about fifty years, they'll start to weaken from rust and may place contaminants into the freshwater supply. We advise changing the steel, iron, and clay pipes in your home.
