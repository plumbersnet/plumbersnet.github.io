<p>The LAGBC is based on the 2013 California Green Structure Standards Code, frequently referred to as "CALGreen" that was established and mandated by the State to attain consistency amongst the various jurisdictions within the State; decrease the building's energy and water use; minimize waste; and decrease the carbon footprint. Continuous feed disposals are simple to run: you run water in the kitchen sink, turn a switch, and feed the disposal with food scraps and compostable waste. With this type of waste disposal unit, however, bottle caps, flatware, and other metal debris can in some cases get captured in the blades. This can damage the blades and require repairs.</p>
<p>Responsive circulation technology works by constantly bringing tanks on-line and off-line in response to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, only one of the four tanks is required to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill. This responsive style enables the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than standard single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
