Run-down and wore away parts make repairs hard and costly, suggesting a faucet installation is more beneficial. Repairs are the proper fix for problems such as missing or damaged washers, aerators, nuts, bolts, and other small elements of the whole fixture. If these repairs and replacements do not work or if the repairs cost over 30% of the cost of replacing your faucet, then we advise a new faucet installation.</p>
