<p>Here at High 5 Plumbing, our Denver drain cleaning team is proud to use Bio-Clean products for every drain-cleaning job. Bio-Clean is a natural service that's both safe to your plumbing and remarkably reliable at removing grime, waste, and natural material that so frequently congests your drain lines. Caustic drain cleaners run along the bottom of your pipes, corroding the sidewalls and only partially fixing the problem. Bio-Clean is a solution of live bacteria that actively seek out natural product and eat away at it, developing harmless byproducts of carbon dioxide, water, and mineral ash, all of which are easily treated at local sewage plants.</p>
<p>Deterioration: The most common issue is corrosion in the tank and pipes that link to your water heater. This is specifically real if you have untreated tough water, which contains extreme minerals that can attach to the piping and tank and break down the material over time. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another component that is causing the rust, you will ultimately experience a leak in your water heater that is difficult to repair. Leakages frequently suggest a new unit replacement is in order.</p>
