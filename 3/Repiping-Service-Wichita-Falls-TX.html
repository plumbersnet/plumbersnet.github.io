<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
