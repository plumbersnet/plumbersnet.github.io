<p>The proper repair of a backflow preventer needs many products to be assessed. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly need to be evaluated. The installation must be evaluated to ensure it does not prevent the workings of the assembly. Test information should be accumulated to figure out the workings of each component. The backflow prevention assembly need to be taken apart and parts changed with initial factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly should be checked once again to be sure it was appropriately fixed. Comparing the test results from the fixed backflow prevention assembly to the producers flow diagram is necessary to ensure it was fixed correctly. A properly repaired assembly needs to provide years of security.</p>
