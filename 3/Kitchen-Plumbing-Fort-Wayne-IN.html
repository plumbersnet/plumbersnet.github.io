<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. But the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance five grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only including 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended day-to-day salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is minimal.</p>
