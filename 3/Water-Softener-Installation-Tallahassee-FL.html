<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Tallahassee FL</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make certain the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed issue. Attempt putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Toilet replacements and repairs are a natural part of being a homeowner. You might sustain much more costly residential or commercial property damage if you wait too long to call a plumber for toilet repairs. Even a slow leak can destroy your floorings and subfloors - leading to significant repairs and even changing the entire floor. An overflowing toilet can flood your bathroom, causing unsanitary conditions, wood rot, and mold growth. As quickly as something appears amiss with your toilet, contact Kingston Plumbing & Heating, Inc. Check out our complete list of plumbing services.</p>
