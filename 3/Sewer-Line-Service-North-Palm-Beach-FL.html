<p>Your home's drainage works by the basic force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets also) it's not really the circulation of water pressing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something blocks the pipes, anything you pour down there will not go through.</p>

<p>Difficult water is brought on by high levels of calcium and magnesium in the water. Water softeners treat the water by using salt and ion-exchange resins to eliminate these minerals. When the water can be found in contact with the resins, the calcium and magnesium ions transfer out of the water and onto the active websites on the resin. Then they are replaced in the solution by the salt ions.</p>
<p>A properly designed watering system is necessary for the health of plants in a landscape but it's also important for human health. An effective irrigation system keeps the water for landscapes different from safe and clean drinking water, preventing contamination that can cause illnesses. That's why a backflow preventer is a requirement on any irrigation job.</p>
