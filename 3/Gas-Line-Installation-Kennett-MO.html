<p>Examine the washer for wear or fractures when you remove the cap to flush out the valve. Replacing a bad washer is easy and inexpensive. However finding the ideal washer may not be. The most common washers are often offered at home centers and hardware shops. Other designs can be difficult to find. If you choose to hunt for a washer, eliminate it and take it to the store to find a match. Plumbers normally replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
