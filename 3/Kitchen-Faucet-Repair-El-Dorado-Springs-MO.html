<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
