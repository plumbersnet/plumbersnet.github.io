Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system need to be checked to make sure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close effectively when re-pressurized.

<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to overcome osmotic pressure and eliminate water molecules from the option with solidity ions. The membrane has pores big enough to admit water molecules for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is devoid of solidity ions with no other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter requiring routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
