<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Center Moriches NY</h3>
<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to collect your yard. Throughout a camera inspection, a sewer and drain professional runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images captured by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
<p>Soft water is safe to consume. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. But the amount of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly thought of. If you have moderately tough water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is minimal.</p>
