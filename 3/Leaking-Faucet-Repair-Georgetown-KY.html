<p>Unusual Sounds - If unusual gurgling is coming from your drain, it most likely needs an extensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it difficult for the water to travel through.

This causes the water to bubble, as just little pockets of air are available, resulting in the unusual noises originating from your sink.</p>

When uncontrolled water pressure causes damage to the plumbing system, this can cause emergency plumbing calls, like flooding.
