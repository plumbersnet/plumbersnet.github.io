<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber Louisa VA</h3>
<p>It is highly advised to seek advice from a plumbing professional to do a plumbing inspection if you are uncertain about any plumbing concerns the home might have. It would not be the very first time that new owners overlooked some major problems due to their lack of experience, state the people who own and operate Dial up Plumbing, which in return will set them back way more than professional plumbing inspection service fee would.

<p>Soft water is safe to consume. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do release salt into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly envisioned. If you have reasonably hard water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
