<p>Lastly, the most complicated and sophisticated backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 independently running valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve serves as a back up system to the other 4. Throughout basic water streams at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a advanced and reliable  (if costly) device is best utilized in crucial areas where cross contamination could be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
