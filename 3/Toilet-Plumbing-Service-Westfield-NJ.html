<p>The issue of leak can be credited to any variety of aspects which can vary from the tank is old and worn, to over-pressurization, in addition to poor maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank should have some room to account for the growth that takes place. The thermal growth needs to get away, hence the need for a growth tank to help control the pressure. If the tank is old and worn, the force applied by the growth taking place when boiling the water causes the tank to split and start leaking.
