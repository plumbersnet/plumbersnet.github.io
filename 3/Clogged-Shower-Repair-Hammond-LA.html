<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release salt into the water when grabbing ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is commonly envisioned. If you have reasonably tough water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's only adding 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the recommended daily salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, comparatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
