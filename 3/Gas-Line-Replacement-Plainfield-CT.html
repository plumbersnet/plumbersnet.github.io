<p>Your sewer line is among the most vital parts of your household plumbing - and if it becomes damaged or clogged, it might wreak unwelcome issues on your home. A house's service line (also called a sewer lateral) runs from your house to the mainline sewer in the street. In many cases, the property owner is responsible for preserving the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is responsible for keeping the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
