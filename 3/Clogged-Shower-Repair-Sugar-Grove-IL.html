Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created since of the procedure. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
