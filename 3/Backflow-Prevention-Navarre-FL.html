<p>Milwaukee, WI - Oct. 12, 2017 - SofTap Water, Inc., a Cincinnati water technology start-up, and a graduate of The Water Council's BREW Corporate Accelerator program in Milwaukee WI, revealed today they have actually achieved a development in water softening treatment using an exclusive Surface Accelerated Condensation (SACr) technology.

<p>Galvanized piping is responsible for a minimum of half of the plumbing emergencies that we encounter in your houses around the Bay Area. The preliminary concerns that occur are the staining of the water, with brown water coming out of a faucet that may have a foul smell. It can also cause stains in clothing put in the washing machine. If your house is over 50 years old, it's an excellent bet it's time to replace the plumbing, at a minimum cost of $2,000 and a maximum of $15,000. The large variation in rate is because of the size of the house, the sort of pipe you're setting up, and additional repairs you find you need to make whenever you go behind walls.</p>
<p>Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that trigger water solidity can be gotten rid of fairly easily by using an ion exchange procedure. Standard water softeners are cation exchange devices. Cations describe positively charged ions dissolved in the water. Cation exchange includes the replacement of the hardness ions with a nonhardness ion. Master plumbers will not charge for their services grossly excessive rates, or otherwise take unnecessary benefit of an unsuspecting public.</p>
