He then disconnected the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my occupants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. Because he had another visit, they called him back and he stated he would not come back. An ideal bad plumber story.</p>
