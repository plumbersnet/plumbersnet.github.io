<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. However the amount of sodium in softened water isn't unhealthy, and really is far less than what is commonly pictured. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water.

<h3>Seven Signs You Need a Professional Sewer Cleaning in Fortuna CA 95540</h3>
<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are a lot of other little toilet parts that need to also be well maintained to help avoid leaks and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense against leakages between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to solidify and crack or simply be so squished that it doesn't fill the space as well as it utilized to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Similar to with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being corroded or so used that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly suggest also changing your gasket and your bolt set to ensure everything is in great shape.</p>
