<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact between dissimilar metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is produced whenever two various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is produced because of the procedure. A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth noting that while using a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to alleviate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and buy a versatile supply of water line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh.
