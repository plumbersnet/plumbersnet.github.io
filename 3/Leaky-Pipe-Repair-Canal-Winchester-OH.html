<p>A cross-connection is any irreversible or momentary connection in between a public water supply or consumer's drinkable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping between a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>Mineral deposits get caught on the sides of a pipe and harden. Gradually, the deposits collect, till they form a bottleneck that makes it harder for water and waste to travel through your pipes. These deposits take place more often when a toilet is old or has a weak flush, since the toilet doesn't have the power to blast the minerals away from the drain pipe. You might have your drain pipes expertly cleaned up if you want to make two times as sure your toilet is the issue before you replace it. If your drain pipes are clean and your toilet still obstructs, it's time for a brand-new one.</p>
