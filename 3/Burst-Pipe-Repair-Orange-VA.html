<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned and checked and the rubber parts have been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some components might have really tight tolerances that need to be kept. An essential thing to recognize on each element is the guide.

If the part is not repaired properly, the guide could limit the motion (rather than direct or stable) of the part, which might cause the element to not work to its capabilities.
