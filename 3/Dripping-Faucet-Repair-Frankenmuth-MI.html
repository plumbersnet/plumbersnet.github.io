<h3>Recent Advances in Sewer Drain Cleaning Technology at Frankenmuth MI 48734</h3>
<p>I bought a "Offer" for $200 toward plumbing services. I have a rental and wished to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (consisting of tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was just 9 months ago. I feel that rates were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March stated depending upon the market and intensity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Pity on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
<p>Responsive circulation innovation works by continuously bringing tanks off-line and on-line in action to the water needs of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation innovation, just one of the four tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. Nevertheless, more tanks come online as the wash bays fill up. This responsive design permits the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than standard single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
