<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation.

If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
