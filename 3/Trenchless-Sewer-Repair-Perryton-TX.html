<p>Organic particles, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY job. If you utilize the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>

I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain.
