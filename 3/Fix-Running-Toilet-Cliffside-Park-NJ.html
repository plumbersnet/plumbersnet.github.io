WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
