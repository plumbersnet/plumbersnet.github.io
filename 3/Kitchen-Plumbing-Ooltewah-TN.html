<p>Tough water use may affect the efficiency of household devices. When heated, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the warm water heater. A big scale accumulation slows the heating procedure and needs more energy to heat water. Hot water heater with big accumulations of mineral buildup will have a shorter life expectancy. Scale deposits also build up to plug plumbing components and develop in other appliances such as coffee pots and dishwashers, hence impacting their efficiency.</p>

If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
