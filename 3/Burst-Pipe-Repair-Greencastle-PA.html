<p>The sink drain was cleared. That worked, however he charged $300 plus tax. Instead of repairing the leak, he wanted to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings instead of a complete replace. He said he would change the washers and that may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there given that it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back due to the fact that he had another appointment. A best bad plumber story.</p>

<p>This post intends to resolve the common misperception that cation -exchange water softening causes rust This is not the case: a correctly configured water softener does not make the treated water more corrosive.
