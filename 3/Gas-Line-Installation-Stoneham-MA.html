<p>The issue of leakage can be attributed to any variety of elements which can range from the tank is old and broken, to over-pressurization, along with bad maintenance. When heating the water, the water heater tank must have some room to account for the growth that takes place. The thermal growth needs to leave, thus the need for an expansion tank to assist regulate the pressure. If the tank is old and worn, the force applied by the growth occurring when boiling the water causes the reservoir to break and begin leaking. The treatment for this is to replace the water heater unit.</p>
