<p>Soft water is safe to drink. During the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when getting ahold of the solidity minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is widely thought of. If you have reasonably difficult water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested daily salt intake. A piece of white bread has around 170 milligrams of sodium, and a slice of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt included by water softeners is negligible.</p>
