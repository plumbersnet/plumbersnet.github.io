<h3>Basic Plumber Tools For Any Job Butler PA</h3>
<p>A newly set up water heater must not produce unusual sounds, but it will begin to produce rumbling sounds as it ages. The sounds get louder in time as the heater goes to heat up the water. Things worsen considerably for households with a high demand for hot water.

A water heater replacement might be needed if the water heater still produces rumbling noises even after it has actually been flushed.</p>
