Instead of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the entire piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't just fix the fittings rather of a complete replace. He stated he would change the washers which may do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted no additional repair. He called me and said the lead was no longer there because it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my tenants attempted the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not come back since he had another visit. A perfect bad plumber story.</p>
