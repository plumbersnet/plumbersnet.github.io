<p>Individuals who compose these articles need to be considerate of the customer and the professional provider.

When the FutureSoft water softener is installed, you will not have a slippery feel to the water as you would have with a salt-based water softener. This does not indicate it's not working. FutureSoft is not including any salt to the water and is retaining the essential, healthy minerals in your water.</p>

After a few minutes, run warm thin down the drain. Inadequate or inaccessible cleanouts: No matter how reliable a drainage system is, it will likely get clogged at some time. Plumbers and homeowners should be able to clean out their drainage pipes when this occurs. Buildings without adequate cleanout valves, or cleanout valves that can't be easily reached, are at danger of a pipe bursting.</p>
