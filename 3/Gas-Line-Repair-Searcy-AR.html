If the element is not fixed correctly, the guide might restrict the movement (instead of stable or direct) of the element, which might cause the element to not work to its abilities. Sometimes springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are restricting the travel of the component triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
