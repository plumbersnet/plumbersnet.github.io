<p>No other room in a home includes as numerous pipes and plumbing fixtures as the bathroom. Look for quality materials when changing an under-sink assembly. Avoid flex pipe that can be bent into any configuration, in addition to versatile rubber traps.

PVC assemblies are a good choice s they can be quickly attached to metal drain pipes. Seal connections with silicone and make sure it sets prior to testing the drain.</p>
