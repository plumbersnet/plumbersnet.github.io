<h3>Fix A Leaking Water Pipe in Woods Cross UT 84087</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one should initially think about problems with the salt that is used, or mechanical breakdowns of softener elements. When these aspects are not the cause of the unsatisfactory water softening, it may be time to replace the softener resin, or maybe even the entire softener. Cation exchange water softeners get rid of the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with salt (or potassium) ions. Once all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener undergoes a regrowth process to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with new sodium ions.</p>
