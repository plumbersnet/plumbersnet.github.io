<p>The majority of demand for plumbers will stem from new building and construction and the need to preserve and repair plumbing systems in existing residences and other structures.

It's likely that the brand-new system will fit the existing bracket if there was an existing disposal connected to the sink already. If not-- or if there is no disposal currently in place-- start by removing the old drain. Most drains are attached to the sink by a big nut beneath the sink that can be turned counter-clockwise to loosen up.</p>
