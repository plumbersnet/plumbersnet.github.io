Variations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will prompt an appropriately working RPZ assembly to periodically release percentages of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be set up in areas based on water damage. Sufficient drainage must also be offered.</p>
