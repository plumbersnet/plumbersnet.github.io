<p>106.2.2.1 Aside From Group R-3 Occupancies. The intent of the 10-percent guideline exemptions in Area 106.2.2 will be applicable to minor repairs and replacement piping just. In buildings aside from Group R-3 occupancies, a license and inspection shall be required for more extensive work if more than 10-percent (nominal) of a floor area, level, or wing is included, even though the floor level, wing, or area defines less than 10-percent (small) of the total building plumbing.</p>
<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump turns off. This is because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The likelihood of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One method to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in most cases it should be much less water.</p>
