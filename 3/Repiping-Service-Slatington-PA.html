<p>Low water pressure. Your plumbing is sensitive to water pressure and relies on a good balance of water pressure in order to work successfully. If your showers become frustrating, or it seems little to no water is flowing out of your faucets, it could be time for a sewer repair. The cost is dependent on the size of the home and the number of bathrooms and plumbing fixtures-- utility room, wet bar, mud room, etc. The cost to repair the drywall that was cut into to access to the plumbing will add $500 or more to your final expenses.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a method or mechanism to prevent backflow. The standard means of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either removes a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The basic system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which offers a physical barrier to backflow. The principal kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
