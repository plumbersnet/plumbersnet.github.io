<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming potable water system. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when unfavorable or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, generally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>

It is important that the plumbing system be switched on very slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system.

When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be examined to make sure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close correctly. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
