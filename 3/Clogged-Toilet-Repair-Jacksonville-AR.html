<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange process, the resin beads do release sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the firmness minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and actually is far less than what is extensively imagined. If you have reasonably difficult water, for example 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just including 37 milligrams of sodium per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested everyday salt intake. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the amount of salt added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
