<h3>How Preemptive Drain Cleaning Can Benefit A Homeowner in Ellicott City MD 21043</h3>
<p>Water that has been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- destructive. For this reason, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this type of rust A softener is simply catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (generally sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
