When heated, calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate settle out of suspension (precipitate) from the water and form a mineral deposit at the bottom of the warm water heater. A large scale buildup slows the heating process and requires more energy to heat water. Water heaters with large accumulations of mineral buildup will have a shorter life span. Scale deposits likewise accumulate to plug plumbing components and develop in other devices such as coffee pots and dishwashers, therefore impacting their efficiency.</p>
