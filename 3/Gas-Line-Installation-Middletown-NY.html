<h3>You Can Save Money With Water Leak Detection in Middletown NY 10940</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
