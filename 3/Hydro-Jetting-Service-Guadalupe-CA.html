<h3>Reduce The Cost Of Hiring A Plumber Guadalupe CA</h3>
<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet blockage down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" unnoticed problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>Water softening refers to the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular approach of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. Throughout ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- normally sodium. The outcome is water that's been successfully softened by getting rid of nearly all traces of the minerals that make up hard water.</p>
