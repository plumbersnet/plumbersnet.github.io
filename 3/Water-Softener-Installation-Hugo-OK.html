Rather of fixing the leak, he wished to replace the whole piping structure for another $300 which would have cost me $600 to clear a drain and plug a leak. I asked why he couldn't simply fix the fittings rather of a total replace. He said he would change the washers and that might do it. He then unplugged the sink, ran the water, didn't see any lead and he entrusted to no further repair. He called me and stated the lead was no longer there since it wasn't on a load. As soon as he left, my renters tried the sink and it was still leaking. They called him back and he said he would not return since he had another consultation. A best bad plumber story.</p>
