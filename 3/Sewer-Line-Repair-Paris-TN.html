<p>Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the basic structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and may fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Improper installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to detect.</p>
