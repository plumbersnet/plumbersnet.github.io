<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code safeguards the public water system and personal on-site water system and circulation systems by restricting cross-connections in between drinkable (suitable for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by needing installation of primary and secondary backflow prevention techniques. Secondary backflow methods offer an increased level of defense for the public water supply system.</p>

Other indications that your drain line must be cleaned up consist of weird smells originating from the drain itself, reduced water pressure from the tap, or overruning water or waste from a sink or toilet.
