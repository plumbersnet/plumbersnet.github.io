<p>Organic particles, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY task. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
