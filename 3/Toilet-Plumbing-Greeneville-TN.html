Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or decreased pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
