<p>All you actually need to do is (THOROUGHLY!) when you have actually discovered the trip lever you desire eliminate your tank lid, unhook the existing lever from the flapper, and unscrew it from the tank. Take your new journey lever, location it in the hole where your old trip lever was and secure it. Bear in mind that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for a lot of toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the proper method. When you have actually secured the journey lever and are ready to connect your flapper, make sure you've got simply enough slack in the chain to guarantee the flapper is sealing firmly over the flush valve yet is still raising all the way when you lower on the trip lever.</p>
