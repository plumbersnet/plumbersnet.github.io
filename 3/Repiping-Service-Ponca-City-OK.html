<p>Property owners can ask for a plumbing inspection at any time, but it is particularly prudent to set up inspections on an annual basis and when purchasing a brand-new home. Storage tank water heaters are typically the least costly systems. However, all storage water heaters lose some quantity of heat with time since they should continuously keep water in the tank hot.

Tankless water heaters cost more to install and buy than storage systems but conserve cash on both energy and water by removing standby heat loss and heating water quicker so less cold water is squandered while you wait.</p>
