<p>Denver Water's Cross-Connection Control and Backflow Prevention Program secures the public water system from contaminants and impurities that could, under certain situations, be drawn into the public water system from private properties. If you need a brand-new toilet, the cost mainly depends upon the toilet you pick. Toilets vary in design, flushing efficiency and bowl shape, all of which make some toilets more expensive than others. When setting up a brand-new toilet, the plumber may likewise need to make adjustments to your bathroom's plumbing, which will raise the overall cost of the job.</p>
