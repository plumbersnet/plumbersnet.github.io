Sometimes conditions on properties change that might need a backflow device, such as treating a boiler with ingredients or setting up a well with a pump. Sewer repairs are more than an inconvenience for your business, they can cause financial losses and in some circumstances can stop your service entirely. For dining establishments having a drain back up or a sewer line break can be devastating. Even in a small workplace the issues caused by even small drain problems can cause major concerns.</p>
<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts must be removed and changed with new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is important that just initial factory repair parts are used. The rubber parts the manufacturer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was developed to use and changing the rubber from the original factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
