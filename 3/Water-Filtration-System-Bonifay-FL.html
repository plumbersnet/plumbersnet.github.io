<p>Upon earning a high school diploma or GED, prospective plumbing contractors need to begin a plumbing apprenticeship. Apprentice programs are the most typical way for plumbers to find out the abilities required to become successful in the trade. Many apprenticeships are sponsored by local unions, companies or contractor organizations. Programs generally last four to 5 years and require apprentices to finish a specific variety of on-the-job training and technical education hours each year.</p>
<p>After you have actually effectively finished the apprenticeship program, you are now qualified to get your own plumber license and be called licensed journeymen. During this phase, you can accept tasks and carry out plumbing jobs without any guidance.
