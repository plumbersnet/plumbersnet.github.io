<p>Minerals in water are what ensures water considered hard." Calcium and magnesium are the most common minerals discovered in water. Typically, minerals arrive due to the fact that groundwater will dissolve rock like limestone, or metals, like iron and the remnants travel with the water up until it remains in your house. Water softening utilizes an ion exchange process to get rid of dissolved minerals that aren't as effectively removed by mechanical filtration. These products are what triggers tough water.</p>

<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Vassar MI 48768</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and changing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The written price quote to clean 3 sinks and 2 tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Only one sink drain was even partly clogged. So, given that I had a "deal" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I looked up notes from last time I had the exact sink cleaned from another company and it just cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months ago. I feel that rates were increased due to the fact that I had a "Deal". An Angie's list short article from March stated depending upon the market and severity of clog, the average cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous receipt to be sure I wasn't getting rate gouged.</p>
