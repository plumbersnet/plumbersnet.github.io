<p>The majority of homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather condition security. As the external covering of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
