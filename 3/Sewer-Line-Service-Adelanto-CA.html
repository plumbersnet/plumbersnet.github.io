Sounds nice, doesn't it? What if we told you that you could do all of that with a tankless, saltless water softener? Well, with NuvoH2O environmentally friendly water supply for homes, you can.</p>
<p>The typical solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an alternative to consider if you reside in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for many decades, but steel ultimately struggles with rust and does not have the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
