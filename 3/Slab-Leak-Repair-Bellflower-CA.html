One typical way for a house's supply of water to be contaminated is if the irrigation water lines, which might become tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines.

A backflow preventer not just protects drinking water in specific houses, it likewise avoids wastewater in private houses from receding out and infecting the general public water supply.</p>
<p>Backflow is the unwanted turnaround of circulation in a potable water circulation system. Water that is constantly under pressure can only flow in one direction. Then how can water circulation in reverse? Water will always flow towards the point of lowest pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened several fire hydrants to help battle a fire, the pressure in the water pipe could drop. The demand upstream could trigger a turnaround in circulation.</p>
