Backflow prevention devices operate by allowing water to stream in only one instructions. In an unprotected water service connection, safe and clean water can flow both in and out of a building or fixture. When water service is interrupted in the street or in a building for any factor, there is a pressure drop which can draw infected water in reverse into the water supply. For example, cleaning fluids may be drawn back from automobile cleans; stagnant water from fire lawn sprinkler may get in the drinking waterline; bacteria and pathogens of all sorts can be siphoned back into the water supply from air conditioning cooling towers; and chemicals from medical clinic's X-ray advancement might flow backwards into the safe and clean water system. To secure water quality, backflow defense is needed where the end user poses a threat of contaminating the city's water supply.</p>
