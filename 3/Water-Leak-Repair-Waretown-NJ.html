<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite sensible. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
<p>Homeowners can practice preventive maintenance to prevent future drainage problems. When a. month, use a plunger in your shower and tub drains to get rid of any stuck-on particles. Pour hot water with liquid soap down the drain, grind some ice cubes and table salt in the garbage disposal to remove grease. Another good trick is using a drain strainer to stay out hair and soap scum from getting in your pipes.</p>
