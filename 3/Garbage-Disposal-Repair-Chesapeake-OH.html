<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on particular new sinks, but these will be identified to that effect. If you can't utilize plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. When you tighten the locknut in location, excess putty will squeeze out between the new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make sure to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another method is to introduce a chemical compound that serves as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and remain suspended in the water rather than developing on surface areas.
