<p>Soft water is safe to drink. Throughout the ion exchange procedure, the resin beads do launch sodium into the water when grabbing ahold of the hardness minerals. However the quantity of salt in softened water isn't unhealthy, and in fact is far less than what is extensively thought of. If you have reasonably hard water, for instance 5 grains per gallon (about 86ppm), that's just adding 37 milligrams of salt per quart of water. That's less than 2% of the suggested day-to-day salt consumption. A slice of white bread has around 170 milligrams of salt, and a piece of pizza has about 640 milligrams. So, relatively, the quantity of sodium added by water softeners is negligible.</p>
