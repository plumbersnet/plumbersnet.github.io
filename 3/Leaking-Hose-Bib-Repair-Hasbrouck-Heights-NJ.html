<h3>Drain Cleaning Techniques in Hasbrouck Heights NJ 07604</h3>
<p>I purchased a "Deal" for $200 towards plumbing services. I have a rental and wanted to do preventative maintenance cleaning the bathroom sink and tub drains, and replacing a toilet fill valve and flapper. The composed price quote to clean 3 sinks and two tubs plus the toilet was $898.13. What? Just one sink drain was even partially clogged. So, since I had a "offer" I had him clean the one sink drain. I was charged $275.64 (including tax) for the one sink drain. I searched for notes from last time I had the precise sink cleaned from another company and it only cost $39.50 plus tax (and another toilet's valve and flapper just cost $118 + tax) which was only 9 months ago. I feel that costs were increased since I had a "Deal". An Angie's list post from March said depending on the market and seriousness of clog, the typical cost to clean a sink drain is $109-$ 214. Shame on me for not bringing my previous invoice to be sure I wasn't getting cost gouged.</p>
