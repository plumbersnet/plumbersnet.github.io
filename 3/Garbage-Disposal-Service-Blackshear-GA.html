An atmospheric vacuum breaker, also called an anti-siphon valve, stops back siphonage with a drifting disc. This disc increases and seals off the air inlet when pressurized and drops to enable air to go into the downstream piping when depressurized.</p>
<p>From beneath the sink, position a rubber gasket and metal or fiber friction ring over the strainer. Secure the gasket and friction ring by screwing on the drain locking ring.
