<p>Leaks are tricky. Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capability to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, offering the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
