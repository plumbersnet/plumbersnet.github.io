<p>Lastly, the most complex and advanced backflow preventer is the minimized pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 individually operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other four. Throughout standard water streams at style pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline.
