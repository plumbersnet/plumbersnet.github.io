<p>Oregon state laws governing water systems require backflow prevention assemblies to be installed on water services where cross connections can not be eliminated. Backflow assemblies are required to be set up on the water service connections to all fire sprinkler and landscape sprinkler systems.

Understanding the appropriate order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be important.</p>
