<p>Template-Assisted Crystallization: Reduced to TAC, this method utilizes resin beads as a catalytic nucleation website where firmness mineral ions are changed into a stable crystalline type that will not cling to surfaces. These crystals are tiny and flow typically through the water. Unlike with a softener that uses ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not need ongoing regrowth.</p>

We highly recommend repiping your home during spring or summertime so you do not have to stress about freezing temperatures during the repiping procedure if you live in a cold-weather environment.</p>
<p>Property owners can practice preventive maintenance to avoid future drainage concerns. Once a. month, use a plunger in your shower and tub drains to remove any stuck-on debris. Pour hot water with liquid soap down the drain, grind some ice and table salt in the garbage disposal to remove grease. Another great trick is using a drain strainer to stay out hair and soap scum from getting in your pipes.</p>
