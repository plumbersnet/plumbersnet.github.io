<h3>Why A Water Leak Detection System Is Important For Your Home in Lebanon MO 65536</h3>
<p>When the water does not become soft enough, one must first consider problems with the salt that is utilized, or mechanical breakdowns of softener components. When these aspects are not the cause of the unacceptable water softening, it might be time to replace the softener resin, or possibly even the whole softener. Cation exchange water softeners remove the calcium and magnesium ions discovered in difficult water by exchanging them with sodium (or potassium) ions. As soon as all the ions are completely exchanged, the water softener goes through a regeneration procedure to flush the system of excess ions and recharge with brand-new sodium ions.</p>

The membrane has pores big enough to admit water molecules for passage; firmness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores.
