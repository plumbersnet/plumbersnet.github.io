Take your brand-new trip lever, location it in the hole where your old journey lever was and secure it. Bear in mind that because of the method a lever works, the locknuts for most toilet journey levers will be reverse threaded so make sure you're turning things the right way. When you have actually protected the trip lever and are ready to link your flapper, make sure you have actually got just enough slack in the chain to make sure the flapper is sealing securely over the flush valve yet is still lifting all the method when you lower on the journey lever.</p>
