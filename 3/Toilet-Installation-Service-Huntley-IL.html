That includes your piping, sinks, faucets, toilets, and other appliances. Even your water lines need to be covered.

<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a versatile water supply line. They're a lot simpler to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make certain to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For a great seal, hold the hose so it aims directly into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the ports. Make them handtight, then add another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can in fact cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If needed, check for leaks and tighten them a bit more.</p>
