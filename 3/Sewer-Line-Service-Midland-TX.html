This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been removed-- destructive.

Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is just catching some cations (mainly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (generally sodium or sometimes potassium).</p>
