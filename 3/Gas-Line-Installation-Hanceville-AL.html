<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts should be eliminated and replaced with brand-new rubber parts. It is important that only initial factory repair parts are utilized when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the manufacturer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was created to use and altering the rubber from the original factory parts will affect the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
