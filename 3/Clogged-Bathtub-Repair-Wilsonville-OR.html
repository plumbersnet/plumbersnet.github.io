<p>As soon as a big adequate source of water has actually been determined and evaluated, the third major component of a water supply system enters into play: a system of pipelines to convey the water from its source to its customers. The biggest of these main long-distance transmitting pipes are described as aqueducts. Typically built of large-diameter (10 feet or more) strengthened concrete pipe sectors, and even tunnels lined with an impenetrable finishing, these are huge underground and aboveground pipes developed to carry bulk flow quantities of water to treatment plants, secondary storage facilities and circulation nodes where the circulations are transferred to smaller-sized branch circulation pipelines.
