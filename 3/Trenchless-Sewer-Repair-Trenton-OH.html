If you do not know, invest the very little cost to have a professional plumber find the lateral for you so that you do not make the error of planting over, to close, or even dig into and break the line. If you are working with someone to plant for you, make certain to mark the area of the line with non-toxic gardening chalk or garden safe paint so that he or she will also understand the locations to avoid. If you have a clean-out, your line will be easy to identify.</p>
