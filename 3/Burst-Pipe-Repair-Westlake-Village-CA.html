<p>Pools of septic waste. If you can see sewage pooling in your backyard, one of the more obvious outdoor indications is. If your backyard smells nasty and there's a puddle that just will not go away, the issue might be a broken main sewer line. The waste disposal unit is leaking: This is caused by a damaged hose or seal. We'll completely examine your system to find the issue and perform the necessary repair.</p>
<p>Caution: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is because the pressure variations caused by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water supply. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of decrease, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless most of the times it must be much less water.</p>
