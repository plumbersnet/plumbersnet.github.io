<p>The basic work week for plumbers is 40 hours (8 hours a day, 5 days a week). Just like numerous professions in building and construction, there are peak periods that will require you to work overtime. The variety of additional hours you work weekly depends upon the building and construction sector and area you operate in, and will vary from one task to the next. Over time, the limescale buildup caused by hard water can result in costly plumbing repairs. A RainSoft water conditioner can help avoid early wear and tear on your toilet.</p>
