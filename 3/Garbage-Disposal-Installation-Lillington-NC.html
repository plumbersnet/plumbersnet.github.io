<p>A backflow preventer is a way or system to prevent backflow. The basic means of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow. The standard mechanism for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which offers a physical barrier to backflow. The principal types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
